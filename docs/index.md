# Welcome

to my personal website. This is where I will try to document whatever I've learned / found interesting across various subjects. This website is split into sections accordingly based on these subjects. You may click the links below to navigate to each section and check them out. Alternatively you may use the nav-bar to the left.

> This website was recently built so there are only two sections currently available. 

## - [TIGM](TIGM/index.md) (Today in Good Music)

## - [Japanese Section ðŸ—¾](Japanese%20Section%20ðŸ—¾/index.md)

## - [Anime Stuff](Anime/index.md)

## - Video Games

## - YouTube

## - [Chess](Chess/index.md)

## - Maths

## - Science

## - Cool artworks

... and more to come as my interests grow
