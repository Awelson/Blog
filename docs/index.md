# Welcome

to my personal website. This is a space where I will try to document/share cool and interesting things to do with my interests. This website is split into sections accordingly based on these subjects (see above).

> For some pages I use the <span style="font-family: mononoki">"mononoki font"</span>. If the text in quotation does not appear different this means that you do not have this font installed in your system. It is not strictly necessary, but you may download the font [here](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) for a better experience.
