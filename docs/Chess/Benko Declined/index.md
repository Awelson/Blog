cxb5 leads to the accepted variation. However, it is often the case that white declines, and there are very many ways to do so (ranked in order of frequency) :

- b3
- Nc3
- e3
- Qc2
- Nf3
- a4
- Nd2
- Bg5

It is also possible for white to divert before reaching this position by not playing 3. d5. The alternatives are :

- [Nf3](3.%20Nf3.md)
- e3
- dxc5
