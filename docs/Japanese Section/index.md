# Japanese Section 🗾

$\small こんにち$-what's up! This is the japanese section where you can find all to do with Japan (except anime; because honestly that requires its own section). This includes bits of Japanese culture I find interesting, and also some resources to do with learning Japanese. I am still learning myself so there might be inaccuracies when I present or translate relevant information.
