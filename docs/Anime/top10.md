# My Top 10 Anime

Not in any particular order, here are my top 10 anime :

## [Odd Taxi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/46102/Odd_Taxi)

You know those types of shows where you have multiple, initially unrelated plotlines focused on different characters slowly intertwining with each successive episode until finally, the mystery of how everything connects to each other is revealed and the point of the story becomes clear? Well, Odd Taxi is exactly that type of show and it did a fantastic job at building up this mystery. Another similar (and also very good) show worth mentioning is [Durarara!!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara).

Also, I LOVE Yano, he's a character that always speaks in [raps and ryhmes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbAIS_7FPPA) for who knows what reason, but he's super cool for it.

## [Sousou no Frieren](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren)

Do I even have to explain myself...

## [Memories (1995)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1462/Memories)

Memories is an anthology consisting of three short (20-40 minutes), standalone films, "Magnetic Rose", "Stink Bomb", and "Cannon Fodder". These films do not have a unifying theme other than their rather experimental nature. For example, "Magnetic Rose" is Sci-Fi, "Stink Bomb" is sort of action/thriller, and "Cannon Fodder" is dystopian/military.

I'm going to talk about "Cannon Fodder" specifically since it is the one I found most interesting. My interpretation of this work is that it is a parody aimed towards overly-militaristic (and borderline paranoid) attitudes in society, a topic which still remains relevant to this day ***coughs*** North Korea ***coughs***. 

The anime follows the daily life of an ordinary family in a city that is perpetually in a state of war. Every citizens' responsibility revolves around contributing to the war effort. For example, every building is comically equipped with artillery, the boy in the family attends a school which teaches military strategy while the mother works as munitions factory worker and the father, an artillery-loader. The anime even features a 7 minute long (out of its 20 minute runtime) sequence which depicts a very detailed, step-by-step loading and firing of an artillery unit. It was even revealed that the existence of an enemy state is even unclear in the first place, yet the city still continues its routine of aimless bombardment. 

On an unrelated note, "Cannon Fodder" was taken in a single continuous shot, i.e, it has no hard cuts. Also check out this [well-written analysis](https://blog.alltheanime.com/memories-cannon-fodder/) of the work by Jonathan Clements.

## [Golden Kamuy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36028/Golden_Kamuy)

A historical anime set in the early 1900s after the [Russ-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War). You can surprisingly learn a lot about this important historical period, and in particular about the culture of the [Ainu people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people), an ethnic minority group residing in northern Japan (Hokkaido, Sakhalin, etc..) where the forefront of the war took place.

It also has a very complex story with multiple independent groups, each with their own dynamic motives. Betrayals are a frequent occurence, a character can be part of one group then all of a sudden switch sides to a different group, two groups may cooperate temporarily only to become enemies again later on, etc.. Although this makes it hard to keep track sometimes, the story is never boring as a result.

Golden kamuy also has some straight up [batshit insane moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nnha04nG2M), while also maintaining to be [serious at times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XScl7MuTQo). Despite this dichotomy, the story still (somehow!?) holds up well.
