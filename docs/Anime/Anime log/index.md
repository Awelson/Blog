# Anime log

I will start logging the anime I've watched (starting from Winter 2022) so I can keep track of things better. If I decide to watch an older anime I will record it in the "older" category. I will also score the anime I've watched according to the following system :

> This is an out of 7, though practically speaking 6 point scoring system. You can thank Frieren for raising the ceiling of my standards. It is the only 7/7 anime in the list as of now, and probably will be for the forseeable future. Anyways, you can see below what each score means; this is based on my reaction after finishing the show.

> - 1 : "Hate it, I want my time back"
> - 2 : "Meh, will probably forget"
> - 3 : "T'was alright"
> - 4 : "That was a fun watch"
> - 5 : "It's over!? shit... I really wanted more of that"
> - 6 : "OMG OMG OMG Ahhh!!"
> - 7 : MASTERPIECE (FRIEREN)
