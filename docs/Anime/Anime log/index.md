# What anime am I watching now?

I will start logging and scoring the seasonal anime I have watched (starting from Winter 2022) so that I can better keep track of things. The scoring system is as follows : 

> This is an out of 8, though practically speaking 7 point scoring system. You can thank Frieren for raising the ceiling of my standards. It is the only 8 point-scoring anime in the list as of now, and probably will be for the forseeable future. Anyways, you can see below what each score means; this is based on my reaction after finishing the show.

> - 1 : Hate it, give me my time back
> - 2 : Forgettable
> - 3 : Meh, alright I guess
> - 4 : Huh, that was quite fun to watch
> - 5 : * gets sad when its over
> - 6 : * freaks out when its over
> - 7 : MASTERPIECE
> - 8 : Uh, its Frieren..
