title : The Pillbug Incident
---

## What is a pillbug?

For those in the audience who do not know (because I sure as hell didn't), the ["pill bug"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae) is a common name given to the *Armadillidiidae* family of woodlice. The pill bug has the ability to roll into a ball, earning them the alternative (perhaps more familiar) name : roly polies.

Despite now being aware of what a pillbug is, I'm sure that you guys are no closer to knowing what ***"The Pillbug Incident"*** could possibly be referring to, but I am going to need you guys to be a bit more patient as I talk about a seemingly unrelated topic.

## Weathernews LiVE

[Weathernews LiVE (WNL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathernews_LiVE) is a private Japanese weather report channel which primarily broadcasts through the internet (as opposed to the television, because I know some of you guys forgot those exist). For example, they sometimes broadcast live and upload clips of their broadcasts on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcB7Cp_igLw). 

WNL is massively popular for simply being a weather report channel, some of their clips have garnered more than 10 million views. Part of the reason why is because WNL's weather reporters are almost exclusively cute, young, females. WNL understands that the audience are watching for the personalities behind the screen as opposed to the weather news itself, and they lean into this by organizing fan meetup events, selling merchandise, etc.. Basically, these weatherwomen are being seen and treated the same way as any other idol. Japanalysis made a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7QG9owYEUY) on this topic, criticizing the normalization of this type of culture. Fortunately, this hotbed of a topic is not something we'll be delving towards; although the context may be helpful. 

## The Pillbug Incident

One of the most famous WNL clips (over 18 million views at the time of writing) is the "ダンゴムシ事件" (pillbug incident), a blooper where the weather caster Rinon Ohshima (大島璃音) mistakenly refers to her colleague, the meteorologist Yamaguchi Takehisa (山口剛央), as a "pillbug", leading to a funny exchange :   

<center>
<div id="player" data-video-id="tzLGA1-QWfU" data-time-points='[{"time":5,"text":""}]'></div>
</center>

The only reason I thought to write about this "incident" is because this blooper is a great way to learn about Japanese particles. Afterall, the cause of Ohshima's unfortunate blunder is the result of an incorrect particle usage. 

## Clip analysis

### Part 1 : The Context

<div id="timestamps" markdown>
<div class="timestamp" data-time="0"><h3>0:00</h3></div>
```
大島 : 今日は結構気温東京上がりましたけどもダンゴムシはまだ今日は見当たらなかったですか？
山口 : 今日は出なかったです。
```
The conversation that will eventually lead to the infamous "Pillbug Incident". Ohshima started by asking Yamaguchi if he was able to find any pillbugs today despite it getting hotter (in Tokyo), to which Yamaguchi replied that he wasn't able to, and the conversation continued on from there.

To understand this bit of dialogue, you will need two pieces of context :

Firstly, the appearance of pillbugs is known to correlate with different weather conditions. For example, pillbugs prefer to live in cool, dark, and moist environments[^1], so you are more likely to see them during or after it rains.

Secondly, Yamaguchi is well known to be a data enthusiast, personally collecting all sorts of data ranging from insect activity to natural disasters[^2]. Ohshima asked if Yamaguchi was able to find any pillbugs today with this context in mind. 

### Part 2 : The Incident

<div class="timestamp" data-time="8"><h3>0:08</h3></div>
<pre><code>大島 : さあ、ということでダンゴムシ<b>にも</b>ね、解説していただきましたけど。
</code></pre>

"Well, with that said, we've received an explanation from a pillbug as well...", said Ohshima, indirectly identifying Yamaguchi as a woodlice. Ohshima's blunder stems from mistakenly marking ダンゴムシ (pillbug in Japanese) with the particle にも. 

In most cases, including this one, にも can be thought of as the particles に and も operating separately[^3]. That is to say, ダンゴムシ is marked twice, once by に and the second time by も. Marking an object with the particle も gives it a sense of "also", "another", "yet again", etc... For example :

```
「私もりんごが好き」: I, too, like apples 
「りんごもすき」: I like apples too
```
In the first case you are proclaiming yourself as an (additional) member of the "apple-liker" group. You would say this when your friends are talking about how much they love apples, and you want to include yourself as a part of that. In the second case you are proclaiming that apples are also a member of the "things-I-like" group. For example, if someone asks "Are bananas the only fruit you like?" then りんごも好き would be an appropriate response.

The particle に is more complex as it has many functions. In this specific instance に acts as :

> "a particle that indicates an agent or a source in passive, causative, もらう/てまらう and other receiving constructions"

- This is the third (out of seven) functions of に according to the dictionary of Japanese grammar (DOJG)[^4]. 

Isolating the key parts of Ohshima's sentence, we get

```
大島 : [ダンゴムシ] [にも] [解説して] [いただきました]
```

いただきました is the past tense of the verb いただく, which means "to recieve". You've probably heard the phrase いただきます (itadakimasu) being used before eating a meal. In this context, いただきます basically means : "I shall humbly receive/accept the food that is in front of me". 

> いただく is no different to もらう apart from being more polite (it is the 謙譲語 of もらう)

A verb can be attached to いただく via its て-form to indicate the receival of an action. In this case :

```
解説する (to explain) -> 解説して + いただきました : (I) received an explanation
```

To indicate the agent of the action that is received, we mark it with a に. Thus :

```
ダンゴムシに(も)解説していたきました : (I) received an explanation from a pillbug 
```

That ダンゴムシ is also marked with a も indicates that the pillbug is part of a larger collection of things that you have received explanations from, or alternatively that the explanation from a pillbug is part of a larger series of events that happened. The second interpretation is probably more accurate.

And so that concludes the explanation behind the grammatical mishap that took the attention of more than 18 million people, **the pillbug incident**.

### Part 3 : Wait? There's More?

What? You think we're done with learning about particles? We're just getting started.

Yamaguchi was quick to correct Ohshima's mistake :

<div class="timestamp" data-time="13"><h3>0:13</h3></div>
```
山口 : ダンゴムシ"の"ですよね？
```
"You probably meant to say 「ダンゴムシ**の**」 (instead of にも) right?", asked Yamaguchi, understandably in disbelief after having just been referred to as a pillbug lol. The の-corrected sentence is then :

```
[ダンゴムシ] [の] [解説していただきました]
```

At first glance, it appears that we have a `Noun + の + Verb` construction, which strays away from the typical `Noun + の + Noun` that we are used to. Having a verb directly follow after the の particle is not impossible (although not super common). After searching around for a bit, I have found at least one case (probably the only case) in which this construction is possible : In attributive clauses, の marks the agent performing an action that serves as an attribute of something else[^5]. 

For example :

```
雪の降る夜 : A snowy night
カナエの作ったネックレス : The necklace that Kanae made
```

In general, we would have : `Noun1 + の + Verb + Noun2`, where `Noun1` is the performer of `Verb` and this serves as an attribute for `Noun2`. However `ダンゴムシの解説していただきました` does not have a `Noun2`, does that mean that the の-corrected sentence is ungrammatical? Surely Yamaguchi's correction to Ohshima's grammar mistake can't yet again be another grammar mistake, that would be too embarassing. Surely, we must have overlooked something.

What we have overlooked is the fact that we do indeed have a second noun, 解説, and that means we can use の in the typical way. It is just that if a noun precedes する, it gets "verbified" :

```
解説 (explanation) -> 解説 + する (to explain)
ダンゴムシの解説 (explanation about pillbugs) -> ダンゴムシの解説 + する (to explain about pillbugs)
ダンゴムシの解説する -> ダンゴムシの解説して + いただきました : (I) received an explanation about pillbugs
```

### Part 4 : Another Correction

<div class="timestamp" data-time="23"><h3>0:23</h3></div>
```
大島 : 違う違う。山口さん、違いますよ
    : 山口さん、ダンゴムシ"も"解説していただきましたけどって
    : 言おうと思ったんですけども
    : 私がちょっと色々間違えまして
```

"No, no, Yamaguchi-san. I meant to say 「ダンゴムシ**も**解説していたきましたけど」, but it appears I made a few mistakes along the way", Ohshima reveals that a rougue "に" has slipped in by accident, her intended sentence was :

```
ダンゴムシも解説していただきました
```

We've already mentioned that a も-marked object is given a sense of "also", "another", "in addition", etc... This means that we can interpret the above as : "Pillbugs (among other things), I received an explanation" With regards to how the rougue "に" slipped in, Ohshima was probably thinking about saying :

```
ダンゴムシ(について)も解説いただきました
```

> Which can be interpreted as "**About** pillbugs (among other things), I received an explanation", 「について」 meaning "about", "with regards to", etc... 

Ohshima then probably forgot to say the ついて part of について.
