title: A short dive into the MAD genre
---

I initially wanted this to be short segment for the [11/08/2024 TIGM](../TIGM/2024/August.md#11082024-2) but I ended up writing much more than expected. 

Here is the song I wanted to showcase :

This is an arrangement/remix (by 墓石) of [the original「原曲を刻む」by 2号](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm28515120). 2号 is an [音MAD](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/音MAD) (otoMAD) music artist, a genre where sound clips from media sources like TV, etc..., are used as the basis for song creation. A classical example of this is the song「柴又」, also by 2号.

The 音MAD genre is a derivative of the [MADムービー](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MADムービー) (MADmovie) genre of videos which is, well, a term used to describe videos created by editing, combining, and reconstructing existing audio, images, videos, and animations from media like TV and games : [Old Example 1](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm19423759), [Old Example 2](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm2275421), [Old Example 3](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm13642288), [Modern Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maOA2StQgq0). 

Sometimes, original animations, music, etc... are created in order to facilitate the "mashing" of different media sources. For example, [this original animation by「絵を描きマツセ」](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG3Huou-1ZI) was created to insert characters from [Dungeon Meshi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52701/Dungeon_Meshi) into the [Chainsaw Man 4th episode ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIKW3NKYBWw). This type of MAD in particular is known as a 手描きMAD.

This is not a Japan-specific cultural phenomenon (although it does appear to be a lot more popular in the Japan-sphere). The western equivalent of this cultural phenomenon is known as [YouTube Poop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_poop) or YTP for short. Here are some examples : [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIfMOGUi98Y), [Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MnrAw8Icfs&pp=ygUMeW91dHViZSBwb29w)

Back to the original topic, the tune for the original「原曲を刻む」by 2号 is, I don't think, derived from an external, pre-existing source. Rather, I believe it is meant to be an exploration/experiment in the application of editing techniques and effects normally used in the 音MAD genre (like repetition, random cuts, reverb, pitch changes, etc...) to an otherwise normal electronic/techno song. Indeed, the song title itself roughly translates to "to mince/chop up a song" and the video presents itself like an 音MAD tutorial, explaining the use of different effects with text. It is essentially a song disguised as an 音MAD tutorial (or an 音MAD tutorial disguised as a song). The arrangement of「原曲を刻む」by 墓石 cleans up and effectively "de-minces" the original song, making the significance/message behind the naming harder to discern.
