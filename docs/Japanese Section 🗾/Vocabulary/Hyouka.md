## **Frequent phrases / words :**

### - 私気になります
**Reading:** (わたし)(き)になるます

Again, a classic example. This phrase is used repeatedly by Chitanda and it is translated as "I am curious" by the english subs.

There are however, some nuances to this phrase. Thankfully this has already been well articulated in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/awwnime/comments/27zhde/what_part_of_kininarimasu_dont_you_understand/) reddit post. A transcript is shown below:

> In case anyone actually cares about understanding the phrase 気になります ("ki ni narimasu"), I'll break it down.
>
> 気 ("ki") is probably the hardest part of the phrase. It's an abstract concept with quite a lot of connotations and it's used as the base of many words and idiomatic phrases (like "realize", "feelings (emotional)", "feeling (physical)", "motivation", etc.). It basically means "spirit"/"mind". The exact meaning will depend on how it's used in a phrase, so I'll come back to it when discussing the phrase as a whole.
>
> に ("ni") is a common particle that marks the previous word/phrase as the the object of the sentence. It usually has a connotation of direction (going toward something, whether it's a physical or abstract thing). The exact connotation depends on the verb it is used with.
>
> なる ("naru") is the verb in the sentence (in root form). It means "to become". It's almost always used after the particle に ("ni"). So, for example, 大人になる ("otona ni naru") means "To become an adult", since "otona" means "adult".
>
> 気 is not a physical object, but rather an abstract concept, so it's not possible for a thing to become a 気. It's also not an adjective, so it doesn't apply to the speaker him/herself - that is to say, the speaker is not becoming 気. Instead, the situation at hand, or a topic that has already been introduced, is becoming 気.
>
> The meaning of 気 in this context is closer to "something on my mind" or "something I'm thinking about". So, the phrase as a whole has a literal translation of "[That] is becoming something that's on my mind". The "That" in the sentence is implicit, and its meaning depends on the situation and what you're applying the phrase to. The most important connotation of the phrase is that the thing that has "become 気" is something that you can't just file away in your memory, but rather something that you can't stop thinking about. It becomes an active and persistent thought, not a passively accepted piece of information.
>
> The point of this breakdown is to point out that the phrase 気になる ("ki ni naru") does not give any information about why you can't stop thinking about this thing. It could be that you want to know more information about the situation (curiosity), but you could also use it to describe something that's starting to worry you, something that you're starting to become interested in because you like it, etc. As long as it's something that you can't get out of your mind, and the feeling is growing, 気になる ("ki ni naru") works. An example would be: if you haven't seen Hyouka, you might say "千反田は気になります" - "Chitanda wa ki ni narimasu" to mean "I think I'm starting to like/become interested in Chitanda" since you see her on r/awwnime so much!
>
> Finally, Chitanda changes the root form of なる ("naru") to the polite form なります ("narimasu"), because she is a やまとなでしこ ("yamato nadeshiko" - "traditionally proper and beautiful Japanese maiden") so she's always very polite to everyone.

In particular, 私**は**気になります no longer means I am curious, but rather "I am becoming something that I care/worry/think about more". Since adding は to 私 makes 私 the subject of the sentence, i.e, the topic that is "turning" into 気.
