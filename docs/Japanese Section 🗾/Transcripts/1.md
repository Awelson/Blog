まふまふ：どうもうみんあさんこんいちわ、まふまふです
```
Hello everyone, this is Mafumafu
```

坂田：坂田です
```
This is Sakata
```

まふまふ：１０回言うてゲーム！
```
It's the "say it 10 times" game!
```

> What they are referring to is a [word association game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_Association). A common example is asking someone to say "fort" 10 times, then ask them what they eat cereal with. Usually people will answer incorrectly with "fork" because of the similarity to the word "fort".

坂田：まって、それは知ってるゲムだわ絶対に
```
Wait, I know this game. I definitely won't be caught off guard
```

まふまふ：うそ～
```
nah, no way
```

坂田：ピザって１０回言ってって言って、じゃあここは？「肘」みたいなやつでしょ
```
Like for example: say pizza 10 times, then what is this? (shows elbow) "hizi" is what people will say right?
```
> The japanese word for elbow is 肘 and is pronounced "hiji", after saying pizza 10 times a person may get confused and say "hizi" instead

まふまふ：さかたんの１０回言ってゲムは古い、ぼくらが小学生の時のやつでしょ
```
Your understanding of the game is outdated, that's back when we were still in elementary school you know?
```

坂田：新しくなってんのこのゲームも、もしかして
```
eh, so the game is updated now huh
```

まふまふ：そんな、「肘」とか「ピザ」とか「ひざ」とか「ピジ」そういうのじゃない
```
Yeah, it won't be the usual culprits like 「肘」,「ピザ」,「ひざ」, or「ピジ」
```

坂田：「ピジ」は聞いたことねえよ
```
I haven't heard of「ピジ」before though
```

まふまふ：じゃあ早速例題を一個やっていきましょかね
```
Then let's try out an example
```

まふまふ：まず僕が十回言って欲しい単語を言うので、そちらを１０回言ってもらって、その後に質問します、それに答えてください
```
First, I'll tell you the word that I want you to speak for 10 times. After you've finished saying it 10 times I will ask you a question, so please answer.
```

坂田：分かりました
```
Understood
```
まふまふ：じゃあ例題行きます
```
Alright then, here comes the example
```

まふまふ：豆板醤と１０回言ってください
```
Please say "doubanjiang" 10 times
```
> [豆板醤](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang) (doubanjiang) is a chinese chili bean paste

坂田：豆板醤ｘ１０
```
"doubanjiang" x 10
```

まふまふ：消防車を呼ぶ番号は？
```
What's the number to call the fire department?
```

坂田：１１０番、違う、そういうことか
```
110.. no that's wrong. Ahh so that's how it's gonna be huh
```
> １１０番 is pronounced "hyaku-toban" hence making it similar to 豆板醤 (tobanjan). The reason for １１０番 being pronounced this way (instead of "hyaku-jyuban") can be found [here](https://news.1242.com/article/360742) (it's a Japanese website tho lol). The gist of it is, there was a popular TV show in Japan, and they popularized the use of the "hyaku-toban" pronounciation 

まふまふ：はいはい　さかちやん
```
Yes, yes, Saka-chan
```

坂田：実際は、実際いくつだっけ？１０９だっけ？
```
The real answer is, uh what is it again? 109?
```

まふまふ：それは渋谷の服屋だね？　「a bit unsure here」
```
That's Shibuya's department store no? 
```
> Like I said, a bit unsure because no subtitles were provided for this bit of dialogue, but Mafumafu seems to be referring to a department store in shibuya called [109](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/109_(department_store)). Shibuya itself is a famous commercial/shopping district in Tokyo.
>
> In addition, he uses the word 服屋 for department store, but that word doesn't appear in any Japanese dictionary. 服 means clothes and 屋 means shop, so it makes sense to use these two words together. Perhaps it's a newer word people have started using these days, who knows?

坂田：なんだけ実際
```
Hmm, what's the real answer then?
```

まふまふ：１１９番です
```
It's 119
```

坂田：俺いつかさ、救急車呼んで！とか　消防車呼んで！って言われたときにさ携帯で、え！？何番だっけ！？って焦るときあんだろうなあと思ってたけど　やっぱパッと言われたら　パッと出ねえは俺
```
At some point when I need to call an ambulance or a fire truck on the phone: "Hang on, what number is it again!?" <- Is what's gonna happen because I'm panicking

Yeah, I don't think I'll be able to say it quickly when I need to
```
> An interesting bit here is the sentence "やっぱパッと言われたら". パッと(ぱっと), which means rapidly, is written in katakana instead of hiragana which is unconventional. 
>
> I'm only speculating but I think the reason is because ぱ is already used in やっぱ so it would be confusing to have something like ”やっぱぱっと。。。”

まふまふ：やるんでしょ？１０９　渋谷行くんでしょ　このジャケットください！
```
You could, couldn't you? Dial 109 for shibuya... Excuse me, can I get this jacket please!
```

**おもろｗｗｗ**
> probably a shortening of 面白い (omoshiroi), and "w" in Japanese stands for a laugh like hahaha or lol in English

まふまふ：じゃあいきますよ、シヤンでリアと１０回言ってください
```
Alright, I'm starting. Please say chandelier 10 times
```
坂田：シヤンでリアｘ１０
```
Chandelier x10
```

まふまふ：毒りんごを食べちやったのは？
```
Who ate the poison apple?
```

坂田：白雪姫
```
Snow white
```

まふまふ：やるね～
```
Ooh.. not bad
```


坂田：シンデレラって言わそうとしたろ　今のはもう。。。ちょっと時間かかっちゃったけど
```
I was about to say Cinderella, but that was... I took a bit of time there
```

まふまふ：なんかちよっと　ラグがあったけど
```
It's as if there was a bit of lag
```

坂田：一瞬脳処理があったね　わかったすぎはマジで　ゼロスピードで行くわ
　今のちよっとズルいしたわ
```
My brain had a bit of time to work, I'll be serious for the next one. I'll answer instantly this time, that one earlier was a bit unfair on my end. 
```
> I was a bit confused here. Sakata said "ゼロスピードで行くわ" which means "I'll do it at zero speed". It sort of doesn't make sense because zero speed means you're going slowly, heck not even moving at all. However, the point is to answer the question quickly, so I assumed that's what Sakata meant to say there

まふまふ：なるほどね、多少はできるようになってきた感があるから
難しいとこ言わせてもらうわ
```
I see, I feel like you've gotten a hang of this already so I'll try something more difficult now
```

坂田：今までのはまさか　まだ簡単だったと
```
The ones I did earlier... those were meant to be easy!?
```

まふまふ：言ったんだろさかたん　例題だって
```
I told you right Saka-tan, those were just examples
```

坂田：なん。。。だと。。。
```
What!? 
```
> It's a bit hard to translate なんだと (nandato) into English, basically なんだと is used to express a sense of disbelief (or shattered hopes) at what the person you're talking to just said. What!? is the best I could come up with.

まふまふ：スプーんと１０回言ってください
```
Please say spoon 10 times
```

坂田：スプーンｘ１０
```
Spoon x10
```

まふまふ：スパゲッティを食べるのは？
```
What eats spaghetti?
```

坂田：フォーク
```
Fork!
```

まふまふ：人間でした！
```
The right answer is human!
```

坂田：おい！おいこら！こらー！


まふまふ：いいね　いいね

> These two dialogues above are hard to translate to English. おい！おいこら！is something said to intimidate a person, usually after they wronged you in some way. Think of some guy bumping into another at a bar and spilling the drink all over, the guy who was bumped into would say おい！おいこら！
>
> As for いいね, it means "that's good". In context, Mafumafu meant that "it's good" that Sakata got the question wrong, "it's good" that he's getting mad/frustrated.


坂田：バカヤロウ！それはもう意地悪だよ
```
You bastard, that was evil
```

まふまふ：いや意地悪じゃないよ　普通じゃない？
```
Nah, no it wasn't. It's just normal no?
```

坂田：それは意地悪だよ
```
No, it was definitely evil
```

まふまふ：よく言うもんね　さかたん　あれ？　さかたんここにあった　
唐揚げ食べたでしょ！俺じゃないよ　箸が食べちやったんだよ　口に油つけながら
```
Well said Sakata (sarcasm). <Impression> Aah, I didn't see you there Sakata. (I am) eating karaage, but it's not me that's eating, it's the chopsticks. I am just having the oil </Impression>
```
> The difficulty here is that the subject of a sentence is often left out in Japanese. Who/what the subject is is supposed to be implicit from context. 
>
> The sentence 唐揚げ食べたでしょ - "I am eating karaage" does not actually refer to a subject, but it is typical for the subject here to be oneself so it is translated as such in English.
>
> Next, Mafu says 俺じゃないよ - "but it's not me (that's eating)", this subverts the initial implicit assumption that Mafu was the subject. He then clarifies that the subject in question is actually the chopsticks
>
> Of course, this is making fun of Sakata's answer: Fork, to the question "what eats spaghetti?"


坂田：うわ～そういう問題なのね　ちよっとずるいな　わかった　そういうの含めて　次やらせてもらうわ
```
So it's that kind of question huh? Seems cunning (or maybe unfair?).. but I get it now, keep those kinds of questions coming
```

**めっちょ弱くて草**
```
What a weakling, lol
```
> 草 (kusa) usually means grass, but nowadays people use it to mean "lol" (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/g3neub/how_the_grass_kanji_%E8%8D%89_became_the_japanese_version/))

まふまふ：どれにしようかな
```
Hmm.. which should I do this time I wonder...
```

坂田：めちゃくちゃ今のずるいな、腹立つなｗ
```
That last one was very cunning, you gotta take it easy on me haha
```
> 腹立つな (haradatsuna) more accurately means to not get angry, but since they're playing a game it makes sense in this context to translate it as "take it easy on me" 

まふまふ：じゃ行きますよ
```
Then I'll start
```

坂田：はい
```
OK
```

まふまふ：「S」と１０回言ってください
```
Please say "S" 10 times
```
坂田：「S」x１０
```
"S" x10
```

まふまふ：「M」の逆は？
```
What is the opposite of "M"?
```

坂田：ごめん！もう一回言って！
```
Sorry! Say that again!
```

ごめんあんま聞き取れなくった　もう一回言って　もう一回「S」言うわ
```
Sorry, I didn't hear it too well, say it again. I'll say S again
```

「S」x１０
```
S x10
```
まふまふ：「M」の逆は？
```
What is the opposite of "M"?
```

坂田：N、あー違うSだｗｗｗ
```
N... ah no its S
```

まふまふ：違うSでもないんだよ
```
Wrong, it's not S either
```

坂田：え、なんで！？
```
Eh, why not!?
```

まふまふ：何でMの逆がNなんだよ
```
How is N supposed to be the opposite of M!?
```

坂田：あれ何だっけ、Mの逆はS。。。だてMSって言うんじゃないの？
```
Ah what was I gonna say? The opposite of M is S... well, because it's called MS right?
```
> Not too sure but maybe Sakata is referring to Mark & Spencers?

まふまふ：Mの逆はWでしょ？
```
The opposite of M is W isn't it?
```
> Referring to how if you turn M upside down it becomes a W

坂田：あーもう！何だよそっちかよ！そちっかよ～～～
```
Aaah, so that's how it is huh, so that's how it is..
```

まふまふ：さかたんも問題出してみる？僕に
```
Sakata, would you like to try asking a question to me this time?
```

坂田：どれくらい理不尽か教えてやるよ
```
I'll give you something outrageous
```

まふまふ：はい　はい
```
Okay, okay
```

坂田：めちゃめち理不尽よこれ
```
I'm serious, it's gonna be real outrageous
```

**攻守交代**
```
Switch sides (offense ↔ defense)
```

坂田：行きます、ケンタッキーって１０回言ってください
```
Alright I'm starting. Please say "Kentucky" 10 times
```

まふまふ：ケンタッキーｘ１０
```
"Kentucky" x10
```

坂田：洗濯機を乾かすのは？
```
What dries the washing machine?
```
> As you will later see, Sakata makes a mistake when asking the question, he meant to say "洗濯物" (laundry) instead of "洗濯機" (washing machine). When the question is asked correctly, it translates to "What dries the laundry?"

まふまふ：乾燥器
```
The drying machine
```

坂田：普通にやってんだ、普通に当ててくんあ！
```
He got it correctly, oi don't just get it correctly like that
```
> If someone were to fall for this question, they would answer 洗濯機 (sentakuki) - "washing machine" which sounds similar to Kentucky

まふまふ：「洗濯物を乾かす」ものじゃないの
```
Shouldn't it be "What dries the laundry?"
```
> Pointing out Sakata's mistake in asking the question

坂田：あ、ホントだ　問題を出す方が間違えてましたね
```
Oh, yeah, that's true. I said the question wrong
```

坂田：じゃあこれ　カバって１０回言って
```
Alright then, what about this one? Say "kaba" (hippo) 10 times 
```

まふまふ：カバｘ１０
```
"Kaba" (hippo) x10
```

坂田：カバがさだ。。。www
```
What is a hippo turned... (bursts into laughter)
```

もう一回カバって１０回言って
```
Sorry, can you say "kaba" (hippo) 10 times again?
```

まふまふ：なんでだよ
```
Why should I!?
```

坂田：もっかい　もっかい
```
again, again, come on
```

まふまふ：カバｘ１０
```
"Kaba" (hippo) x10
```

坂田：カバが逆立ちすると?
```
What is a hippo turned upside down?
```

まふまふ：えなに？バカ？
```
Eh, what? "baka"?
```
> 逆立ち is commonly translated as handstand/headstand. In this context it is used to mean turned upside down. Saying "what is a headstanding hippo?" would be inaccurate because that verb is usually reserved for humans only
>
> 逆立ち can also mean reversed, so there are two interpretations to "カバが逆立ちすると?" Either "what is a hippo turned upside down?" or "what is the word カバ in reverse?" It is more accurate to use the first interpretation based on the context.
>
> Mafumafu incorrectly applied the second interpretation, reversing the word カバ into バカ (which coincidentally means idiot) and giving that as an answer

坂田：カバでした～　カバは逆立ちしてもカバだよ　このおバカ
```
The right answer is hippo.. if you turn a hippo upside down it's still a hippo.. hehe this idiot
```

腹立つっしょ
```
You're starting to get mad now right?
```

まふまふ：クソおおお
```
Damn it!!
```

坂田：おバカだなぁ
```
What an idiot
```

まふまふ：うざすぎる　ｘ２
```
That's so dumb.. so dumb
```

坂田：うっとうしいでしょ？これ
```
Feels irritating right?
```

まふまふ：うっとうしいわぁ
```
Yeah...
```

坂田：じゃあこれいきましょ
```
Alright, here comes the next one
```

じゃあ桃太郎って１０回言ってもらっていいですか
```
Can I have you say Momotaro 10 times?
```
> [桃太郎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D) (Momotaro) is a character from japanese folklore

まふまふ：はい、桃太郎ｘ１０
```
Ok, Momotaro x10
```

坂田：川から流れてくるのは？
```
What flows from the river?
```

まふまふ：水？
```
Water?
```

坂田：あってる。。。桃って言えよそこはああ！
```
You got it right... you were supposed to say peach (momo)!
```

クッソ　冷静な奴め
```
shit.. you're good at this
``` 

こいつこのゲームを理解してるな
```
This dude gets this game
```

まふまふ：これがあれよ　処理速度よ
```
That's what you call (a quick) processing speed
```

坂田：わかった、でも俺もこのゲームすでに理解したわ　もう一回やらせて
```
Alright, but I'm starting to get a hang of this game too. I'll play another round
```

最初の１０回全く関係ないって考えたらいいんだね
```
I may have messed up earlier, but it's gonna be different now
```

まふまふ：わかった、行くよ. 温泉って１０回言ってください
```
Alright then, I'll start. Please say "onsen" 10 times
```

坂田：温泉ｘ１０
```
"Onsen" x10
```

まふまふ：３０００の次は？
```
What comes next after 3000?
```

坂田：４０００
```
4000
```
> 4000 is pronounced "yon-sen", similar to "onsen", hence the mistake
