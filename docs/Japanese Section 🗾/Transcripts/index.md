# Transcripts

There are Japanese videos on YouTube with kanji subtitles edited in (but no English subtitles). To find these types of videos I enter

```
[Name of Japanese Streamer] + 切り抜き (or 手書き切り抜き)
```
into YouTube.


Translating them by hand is a huge task, but also a very rewarding exercise. Below you may find some videos that I have translated, of course keep in mind the accuracy won't be perfect.

You are free to use the transcript and its translation as a way to learn, or alternatively to just be able to understand the video without knowing Japanese 

> but it helps to know at least a bit so you can track and read the transcript more efficiently
