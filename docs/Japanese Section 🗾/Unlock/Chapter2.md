# Chapter 2 - I am not an eel

This chapter describes the confusion areound the sentence "私はうなぎです". This phrase is spoken (when ordering as a group in a restaurant) to indicate that you would like to order some eel. However, if "私は学生です" means "I am a student", shouldn't "私はうなぎです" mean "I am an eel"? To explain this apparent discrepancy we introduce the idea of the "core structure" of a Japanese sentence.

## Core Structure of a Japanese Sentence

Fundamentally, a Japanese sentence, when stripped to its core structure, presents itself in one of the following forms :

- AがBです, where A is the grammatical subject and B is a noun
- AがB, where A is the grammatical subject and B is a verb in plain form
- AがB, where A is the grammatical subject and B is an i-adjective

That is to say, a sentence at its core involves communicating the following ideas :

- Associating the subject "A" with the noun "B", for example "私が学生です"
- Describing an action "B" that is being performed by the subject "A", for example "私が食べる"
- Describing a subject "A" with the adjective "B", for example "顔が赤い"

There will be multiple initial concerns to this concept. The most striking is that "私はうなぎです" does not contain a が and hence I am being contradictory. However, there is nothing of the sort happening because the grammatical subject + が in "私はうなぎです" is hidden/implicit (as often is the case with most Japanese sentences). If we try to forcibly reveal the grammatical subject in the sentence we will end up with something like

$$私は　\varnothing が　うなぎです$$

Where whatever $\varnothing$ should be is usually clear from context. We now see that the core structure of this sentence is of the form "AがBです". From context it is pretty clear that $\varnothing$ is referring to "the thing I will have", and thus at its core "私はうなぎです" is communicating the association of "what I will have" (the grammatical subject) with "eel" (the noun). The important point is that the は particle **never** marks the grammatical subject of the sentence, that is が's job. 

## What does は do?

This now begs the question: what purpose does "私は" serve in the sentence? In general, elements of a sentence that are not part of the core structure serves the purpose of adding detail and context to the core structure. For example, the は particle is often interpreted as a topic marker, it marks the topic of the sentence. は does not provide/communicate a precise relation between the marked "topic" and whatever is going on in the rest of the sentence, just that the topic is related (in some way) to the sentence. Another way to understand は is that "Aは◯◯" can be roughly translated to "as for A, ◯◯" or "speaking of A, ◯◯". Thus, "私はうなぎです" could be translated as "As for me, what I will be having is eel".

Is 私は necessary in the sentence? Not necessarily. For example, If you are by yourself and a waiter comes up and asks "What will you be having?" It is sufficient to reply with "($\varnothing$が)うなぎです" and the waiter should easily understand that the implicit grammatical subject, $\varnothing$, is referring to what the customer (you) will be having. In other situations "うなぎです" may be too vague. If you are part of a group and the waiter asks "What are everyone's orders?", then there is not enough context for the waiter to decipher what $\varnothing$ is when you simply reply with "うなぎです". For example, $\varnothing$ may refer to everyone's orders, i.e, the waiter may interpret "うなぎです" as "Everyone will be having eel", or $\varnothing$ may refer to your individual order, i.e, the waiter may interpret "うなぎです" as "Only this customer (the one speaking) will be having eel", etc...

> This is akin to simply replying with "Eel" when the waiter asks "What are everyone's orders?", it is too vague.

## は vs が

In the sentence "私は($\varnothing$が)学生です", the topic and the implicit subject are both the same, that is they are both 私. What is the point of this redundancy? In particular, does 私は学生です and 私が学生です communicate different ideas? The short answer is they both communicate the same core idea "I am a student" but with differences in nuance. For instance, using は usually leads to the subject + が (the "A" part) being concealed and this would bring more focus / attention to the predicate (the "B" part) of the core sentence structure. For example, in a situation where everyone is sharing their occupations, you would want to bring attention to "am a student" as opposed to "I/me", hence you would say 私は学生です. In contrast, "私が学生です" explicitly mentions the subject and you would say this in a situation where you would like to bring attention to "I/me", like when someone asks "Who here is a student?"

However, は vs が is a very complicated topic and this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the nuance between these two particles.

## $\varnothing$ ≅ it

If the idea of an implicit / hidden grammatical subject seems unnatural, then it may help to consider that English has an equivalent idea, and that is the word "it". In the sentence "it is cold", "it" serves as the subject of the sentence. Although "it" is explicitly present in the sentence, what "it" actually means or corresponds to is implicit. For example, what is really meant by "it is cold" could be "the weather is cold", "the water I'm drinking is cold", etc.. "it" is simply a placeholder for the actual subject of the sentence (which is made clear by context). Thus, "it" plays a similar role to $\varnothing$. The only difference is that "it" has a sound while $\varnothing$ does not.   

To illustrate, 寒いです is often translated as "it is cold". "it" is not explicitly written or spoken out in "寒いです". Instead, "it" is the implicit (and silent) grammatical subject of the sentence, i.e, 

$$\overset{\raisebox{3px}{\text{it}}}{(\varnothingが)} \quad \overset{\raisebox{4px}{\text{is cold}}}{寒いです}$$

Although there is no explicit way to express the word "it" in Japanese, people are aware and make reference to the idea of the word "it" whenever they make statements like "寒いです". Point is, whenever you have a sentence in which the implicit grammatical subject is unclear you can just replace it with the word "it" when translating.
