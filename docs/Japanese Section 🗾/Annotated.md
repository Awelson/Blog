# Annotated Videos

Here are some Japanese YouTube videos that I have annotated which can be used as learning material. Of course I do not claim that these annotations are perfect, so take it with a grain of salt. Most of the videos I choose are from animated clips of Japanese streamers which I find by typing

```
[Name of Japanese Streamer] + 切り抜き (or 手書き切り抜き)
```

into YouTube. I also take videos from the channels [私立パラの丸高校](https://www.youtube.com/@parako) and [マリマリマリー](https://www.youtube.com/@marymarymary80s) which make comedic animations.
