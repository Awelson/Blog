# Understanding the が and を particles

requires the understanding of transitive and intransitive verbs. This concept has been mentioned in passing, but we shall explore it deeper in this chapter.

## Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

- **Transitive verb** : a verb (performed by the subject) whose action is or can be directed towards a direct object (which may include the subject itself)

- **Intransitive verb** : a verb (performed by the subject) which does not involve a direct object

For example, 

$$ \underbrace{\text{She}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{broke}}^{\text{verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{the vase}}_{\text{object}} $$

and 

$$ \underbrace{\text{The ice}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{melted}}^{\text{verb}} $$

It is worth noting that the same verb may function both transitively and intransitively in different contexts. Take the transitive example given above and the following example :

$$ \underbrace{\text{The phone}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{broke}}^{\text{verb}} $$

> It is possible for a transitive verb to take the subject itself as the direct object like in the sentence "She broke herself". It is also not always necessary to explicitly mention the direct object when using a verb transitively like in the sentence "I ate". 

## Passive voice

While we are at it, let us also explain the English passive voice. This involves the subject of the sentence being the recepient of an action performed by some agent. To communicate this idea we use the passive form of a verb, "kick $\to$ is kicked", "laugh $\to$ is laughed at", etc... 

This is probably incorrect, but I think that it helps to view the passive form of a verb as if it were still a verb, for example in the sentence

$$ \underbrace{\text{The ball}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{is kicked}}^{\text{passive verb}} $$

We can view "is kicked" as the action "to recieve a kick from some agent". Put together, the subject (the ball) is performing the action "to recieve a kick from some agent". It can be hard to wrap your head around passive voice and intransitive verbs due to the structural similarities. Here is an example to help. Consider the following:

- **Intransitive** : My TV broke down.
- **Passive** : My TV was broken down.

Although similar, these two sentences communicate different meanings. The first implies that no one is to blame for this incident, the TV just broke down on its own. The second implies that some agent is responsible for the breakdown of the TV.

## Back to Japanese

In Japanese, the doer (the subject) of a verb (be it transitive or intransitive) is, as you should know, marked with a が. In the case of transitive verbs, the direct object (if present in the sentence) is marked with an を.
