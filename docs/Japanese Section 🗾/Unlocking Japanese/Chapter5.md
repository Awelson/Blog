# Understanding the が, and を particles

There are two prerequisites to mastering these particles. First, we need to be accustomed to transitive and intransitive verbs. Second, we need to be accustomed to the use of passive voice. We review these topics in English before moving on to Japanese.

## Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

- **Transitive verb** : an action that must be directed towards a direct object

- **Intransitive verb** : an action that does not involve a direct object

For example, 

**Transitive :**

$$ \underbrace{\text{She}}_{\text{subject}} \overbrace{\text{owns}}^{\text{verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{a car}}_{\text{object}} $$

> You can't just say "She owns" without specifying what (the direct object) she owns now can ya?

**Intransitive :**

$$ \underbrace{\text{He}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{yawned}}^{\text{verb}} $$

> Yawing is just something that you do, there is no involvement of some direct object

!!! note

    A lot of English verbs can function both transitively and intransitively in different contexts (such verbs are known as [ambitransitive verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambitransitive_verb)). Take the example :
 
    $$ \underbrace{\text{She}}_{\text{subject}} \overbrace{\text{broke}}^{\text{verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{the vase}}_{\text{object}} $$

    $$ \underbrace{\text{The phone}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{broke}}^{\text{verb}} $$

    "broke" is used transitively in the first example and intransitively in the second.

!!! note

    There are cases where the subject itself is used as the direct object like in the sentence "I punched myself". This is still a transitive usage of "punched", the direct object need not be something external from the subject.

## Passive voice

The English passive voice involves the subject of the sentence being the recepient of an action performed by some agent. To communicate this idea we use the passive form of a verb, "kick $\to$ is kicked", "eat $\to$ is eaten", etc... 

Notice that the passive form of a verb still functions as a verb in the usual sense, for example in the sentence

$$ \underbrace{\text{The ball}}_{\text{subject}} \ \overbrace{\text{is kicked}}^{\text{passive verb}} $$

we can think of "is kicked" as "to recieve a kick from some agent"; nothing drastic is happening when we switch to the passive. Put together : the subject (the ball) performs the action "to recieve a kick from some agent".

> This is just one of the ways to think of / understand the passive voice. I don't think it is a standard (or even correct) way to do so, but this way of thinking, I think, is the most compatible with Japanese.  

It can be hard to wrap your head around passive voice and intransitive verbs due to the structural similarities. Here is an example to help. Consider the following:

- **Intransitive** : The door opened.
- **Passive** : The door was opened.

Although similar, these two sentences communicate different meanings. The first implies that there is no agent (either a person or a phenomenon) responsible for the opening of the door, the door just opened on its own, i.e. the door is the subject and it performed the action "open". The second implies that some agent is responsible for the opening of the door.. the door is the subject and it is performed the action "to recieve the action "open" from some agent".

!!! note

    In "The door opened", or when a verb is used intransitively in general, the speaker does not necessarily believe that the door opened on its own. For example, they may simply not want to bring attention to the existence of an agent for whatever reason <- This thought pattern is very common in Japanese as we shall see.

!!! note

    You may have heard from somewhere that intransitive verbs cannot be put into passive voice. The above example seems to break that rule, but notice that "open" is ambitransitive. 

    "The door was opened" is the passive voice of the sentence "He opened the door" (in which "open" is being used transitively). The existence of an agent, in this case "He", is implied but not made explicit upon conversion to the passive voice. The agent can be made explicit with prepositional phrases (explained soon). For example, we can include the prepositional phrase "by him" : 

    <p align="center">"The door was opened by him"</p>

    Thus, it is perhaps more accurate to say that a sentence in which a verb is used intransitively cannot be put into the passive voice.

## Intransitive verbs can behave transitively

with the use of a prepositional phrase (PP). Now, what is a PP?

> *From the Britannica Dictionary* : 
>
> A prepositional phrase is a group of words that begins with a preposition and ends with a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase (this noun, pronoun, or noun phrase is the object of the preposition).
>
> Prepositional phrases modify or describe nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. They say something about the relationship between their object and the word they describe or modify.

Example :

$$ \underbrace{\text{He}}_{\text{subject}} \overbrace{\text{laughed}}^{\text{verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{at }\overbrace{\text{me}}^{\text{object}}}_{\text{PP}} $$

Eventhough "laugh" is an intransitive verb, it behaves transitively in this example since we get the impression that the "laugh" action is directed towards the object "me". However, notice that "me" is simply an object within the PP "at me" and it is the PP as a whole that helps to describe the verb "laughed". Thus, while "me" *is* an object, it cannot be considered as a direct object in this context.

While it has been said that intransitive verbs cannot be put into passive voice, we can make use of PPs to create a passive construction of an intransitive verb. For example,

$$ \underbrace{\text{I}}_{\text{subject}} \overbrace{\text{was laughed}}^{\text{passive verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{at (by him)}}_{\text{PP}} $$

and we may or may not include "by him" to reveal or hide the agent (but you should always include "at").

!!! note

    To make use of all this English grammar knowledge in a Japanese context, simply remember the following guidelines

    - the subject is marked with が
    - the direct object is marked with を

## Back to Japanese

Let us now discuss these grammar points in the context of the Japanese language. While there are similarities to English, there are also some differences which we shall point out.

## (Japanese) Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

While ambitransitive verbs are common in English, they are quite rare in Japanese. Instead, most Japanese verbs come in transitive-intransitive pairs, that is a transitive verb may come with a separate verb that can act as its intransitive counterpart and vice-versa.

For example, while "open" is ambitransitive, in Japanese there are separate versions of "open" depending on whether you are using it transitively or intransitively in a sentence. The transitive "open" is given by「開ける」and the intransitive "open" is given by「開く」.(1)
{ .annotate }

1. 開く can also be used transitively but we'll ignore that for now

Example :

- 私がドーアを開ける ⋅ I open the door 
- ドーアが開く ⋅ The door opens 

Here are some other examples of Japanese transitive-intransitive verb pairs and their corresponding English ambitransitive verb

- 起こす/起こる (wake)
- 回す/回る (turn)
- 始める/始まる (start)
- 見る/見える (see)*
- 聞く/聞こえる (hear)*

## Unaccusative vs Unergative

Consider the following :

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 0; padding: 0" markdown>
|              |        Turn       |       See      |
|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
|  Transitive  |   I turn the box  |  I see a bird  |
|    Passive   | The box is turned | A bird is seen |
| Intransitive |   The box turns   |     ??????     |
</div>
> Note. The emphasis on the agent diminishes as we descend the table

While "see" can be used intransitively like in the sentence "I can't see without my glasses", there is no way that we can use "see" to fill in ?????. When a verb is used intransitively it can be separated into two categories based on whether or not they can fulfill this role. We say that "see" is unergative because it cannot fulfill this role while "turn" is unaccusative since it is able to.

In Japanese, intransitive verb pairs are almost always unaccusative. For example,「見える」and the intransitive "see" do not correspond with each other since one of them is unergative and the other is unaccusative. Thus,「見える」has no perfect English equivalent since there is no unaccusative "see". The closest we can get to an English equivalent is probably "to be visible".

Here is the previous table in Japanese :

<div style="text-align: center" markdown>
|              |        回る/回す       |       見る/見える      |
|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
|  Transitive  |   私が箱を回る  |  私が鳥を見る  |
|    Passive   | 箱が回られる | 鳥が見られる |
| Intransitive |   箱が回す   |    鳥が見える     |
</div>

Here is another example using the unergative "catch"

<div style="text-align: center" markdown>
|              |        catch       |       捕まえる/捕まる      |
|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
|  Transitive  |   The policeman caught the thief  |  お巡りさんが犯人を捕まえた  |
|    Passive   | The thief was caught | 犯人が捕まえられた |
| Intransitive |   ?????   |    犯人が捕まった     |
</div>

> Note again the decreasing emphasis on "the agent" (the policeman) as we descend the table. In Japanese, there is a cultural preference to not emphasize the agent, only doing so when absolutely necessary. Thus, the intransitive form is almost always preferred when communicating.

## Transitivity mismatch

The verb「分かる」is often translated in English as "understand", though this is inaccurate since「分かる」is intransitive while "understand" is transitive. If we insist on using this translation, then「(私は)これが分かる」translates to "(I) understand this". In the Japanese sentence the subject is「これ」while in the English sentence it is "I", this is due to the transitivity mismatch.

Like the "thief" example above, there is no direct English equivalent to「これが分かる」(since "understand" is unergative). Here is an excerpt from [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/わかる) that explains this clearly :

> The Japanese verb wakaru is most often glossed as to understand. However, wakaru is intransitive, and it takes the thing that is understood, distinguished, or recognized as the subject (usually marked by particle が (ga)), and not the object (usually marked by particle を (o)). Strictly speaking, wakaru is thus closer to English to be understandable, as the verb wakaru describes the thing itself, unlike English to understand, which describes the action of the person doing the understanding, distinguishing, or recognizing.

「分かる」's transitive pair is「分ける」, but this means "to separate" instead of "to understand". Throughout the course of history the Japanese intransitive "separate", that is「分かる」, somehow had its meaning morphed into "to understand". Here is the most likely explanation for this :

> My guess is that the English translation “to distinguish” (or more accurately, to be distinguishable!) is probably the closest bridge between the meanings “understand” and “separate”. The root “dis” even means “apart”.
>
> You can distinguish one red marble in a bag from all the other blue marbles. That both carries this mental image for me of the red marble standing out, or being apart from, all the others; you can see it’s borders; in your mind’s eye, you draw a mental border around it’s edges and cut it away from all the other noise in the picture. This sense of “distinguish” seems related to separating, to me.
> 
> But “distinguish” also means you’re seeing it clearly-- you can’t distinguish a blurry shape in the bag if you have bad eyesight. To see it clearly and sharply sounds a lot like what your mind would do with a hazy, non-concrete concept. You can distinguish a concept and make it out-- it is distinguishable in your mind. You understand it.

Another example of a verb that suffers from this "transitivity mismatch" is「できる」which is often mistranslated as "to be able to do" despite「できる」being intransitive. 

## The intransitive passive?

The examples of passive form (in Japanese) which we have showcased are created by taking the passive form of the transitive verb pair. In the "thief" example, we use「捕まえられる」, the passive form of「捕まえる」, the transitive "catch". However, what's special about Japanese is that we also have access to the passive form of「捕まる」, the intransitive "catch". This yields the word「捕まられる」.

I will be honest and say that I have no clue as to how to interpret or use「捕まられる」and other "intransitive passives". 

??? note "So.. I asked an LLM and.."

    「捕まえられる」と「捕まられる」はどちらも受け身形として使われることがありますが、意味に違いがあります。
    <h3> 1. 捕まえられる（受け身形）</h3>
        - 動詞「捕まえる」の受け身形。
        - 意味: 誰か（主語）が他者に捕まえられる（他の人によって捕まえられる）こと。
        - 例: 「彼は警察に捕まえられた。」→ 警察が彼を捕まえたという意味です。
    <h3> 2. 捕まられる（受け身形）</h3>
        - 動詞「捕まる」の受け身形。
        - 意味: 誰か（主語）が他者に捕まる（その人自身が捕まること）こと。
        - 例: 「彼は警察に捕まられた。」→ 彼自身が警察に捕まったという意味です。

    <h3> 違いのポイント： </h3>
        - 「捕まえられる」: 誰かが他の人や物を捕まえるという行為の受け身形。主語は捕まえられる対象です。
        - 「警察に捕まえられる」→ 警察が主語を捕まえる。
        - 「捕まられる」: 主語が自分自身で他者に捕まるという受け身形。主語自身が捕まるという意味です。
        - 「警察に捕まられる」→ 主語が警察に捕まる。
    <h3> 例文での比較： </h3>
        - 「彼は警察に捕まえられた」 → 警察が彼を捕まえた（他者が彼を捕まえた）。
        - 「彼は警察に捕まられた」 → 彼が自分で警察に捕まった（彼自身が捕まった）。
    それぞれのニュアンスの違いに注意して使い分けることが重要です。

    It appears that「捕まえられた」can be thought of as "to be caught" and「捕まられた」 as "to turn one's self in". But of course, I cannot guarantee that this is 100% factual.

The good thing is that they are not frequently used so it's cool to not understand them. Nonetheless, here are some examples I was able to find :

> Since English intransitive verbs do not have a passive form, there is no direct equivalent for common Japanese expressions such as the following:
>
> - 子供に泣かれた。(The child cried. / I couldn't stop the child from crying.)
> - 雨に降られた。 (We were caught in the rain.)
>
> [Source](https://user.keio.ac.jp/~hjb/passive%20verbs.html)

## The suffering passive

$$かばんが盗まれた$$

"(My) bag was stolen". This sentence, in both English and Japanese, does not really convey the negative impact of this situation (towards the owner of the bag). The subject is "the bag" (かばん) and it received the action "steal" (盗まれた) from some external agent, there is no emphasis on the owner of the bag.

In English we might instead say "I was stolen from, they took my bag", or some other equivalent to help convey the negative impact of this situation. In Japanese we might say「私がかばんを盗まれた」, now "I (the owner)" becomes the subject, *I* received the action "steal" from some external agent; and what they took was my bag. This is known as the 'suffering passive'.

Now, there are some issues to be addressed. When a sentence is turned passive the direct object turns into the subject so that, in a sense, a passive sentence should not have a direct object. Yet「私がかばんを盗まれた」has an を-marked object. One could simply treat this as an edge case, a minor discrepancy to the rules, and that is fine. However, there is an unconventional way of thinking about Japanese verb conjugations which resolves this discrepancy. I will eventually get around to introducing these ideas, but for now here are some videos you can watch (in order) :

- [Lesson 10: "Japanese conjugation" myth busted! Also, potential verb form secret unlocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcOhHmU0znI)

## Quickfire points

- Japanese transitive verbs may appear to be without a direct object.

!!! note "For example"

    「飲む」is transitive, but it does not appear with an を-marked object in the sentence「昨日は朝まで飲んだ」. This is not really an instance of a rulebreak but rather the Japanese tendency to omit information. Revealing the implicit information gives「昨日は朝まで(〇〇を)飲んだ」where 〇〇 probably refers to 酒.

- Japanese has ambitransitive verbs, but these are rare (e.g. 噴く)

- Some Japanese transitive verbs don't have an intransitive pair (e.g. 食べる) and vice versa (e.g. 泣く)

<!--
Let us put these guidelines to use. "Go" is an intransitive verb. "Go" doesn't accept direct objects so we have to use PPs to provide additional context if need be, e.g. "Go to the convenience store". The object (convenience store) which represents the directionality/destination of the verb "Go" is an object inside of a PP as opposed to a direct object. 

The Japanese verb for "Go",「行く」, is also intransitive so translating

$$ \underbrace{\text{Go}}_{\text{verb}} \ \underbrace{\text{to }\overbrace{\text{the convenience store}}^{\text{object}}}_{\text{PP}}  $$

is simply a matter of making use of the guidelines :



$$ \underbrace{\overbrace{\text{コンビニ}}^{\text{object}}\textcolor{#f02464}{に}}_{\text{PP}} \overbrace{\text{行く}}^{\text{verb}} $$

> Note. The PP usually goes before the verb in Japanese

Introducing a subject is simple enough :「私がコンビニに行く」. However, some English verbs
