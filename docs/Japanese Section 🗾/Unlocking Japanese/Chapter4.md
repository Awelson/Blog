# Chapter 4 - Upside-Down Japanese

This is a short chapter which further goes into more examples of how inaccurate English translations create confusion while learning, a topic that was touched on briefly in the previous chapter.

## Example 1

$$ 私はケーキが好きです, $$

usually translated as "I like cake". Notice that「好き」is a na-adjective but the English translation makes it out to be a verb. Indeed, it is「ケーキ」that is marked with「が」and not「私」. The cake is the subject of the sentence, it is the one that is manifesting the trait of "being liked" or "pleasing", just like how "house" is the subject in "That house is big".   

A more literal translation of the above sentence is one which presents "cake" as the subject, i.e. a sentence like "To me, cake is pleasing".

This is an instance of a "concept" being referred to / communicated in different ways by different parts of society. In English, the concept of "like" is seen as a verb whereas in Japanese it is seen as an adjective. However, this is simply a matter of convention; how a language views a concept is not immutable. For example, in English it is possible to view the concept "like" as an adjective with the use of the word "pleasing", and in Japanese "like" can be viewed as a verb with the word「好く」.

## Example 2

Here is an example in the reverse direction, i,e. a concept that is conventionally viewed as an adjective in English but as a verb in Japanese.

$$ それが大きくすぎる $$

「すぎる」is an intransitive verb with the meanings, "to exceed", "to surpass", etc... 「大きく」(the adverbial form of the adjective「大き」) plays the role of an adverb, describing "in what manner/context" is the subject「それ」performing the action「すぎる」. Taken together,「それが大きくすぎる」can be interpreted as : 

<div align="center" > (the object) "that" is performing the action "to exceed in terms of size" </div>

Thus, the concept of "too big" is communicated as a verb. In contrast, the natural English translation "That is too big" communicates the concept of "too big" as an adjective. 

> More colloquially, the「く」in「大きくすぎる」is dropped without change to the meaning. This pattern also applies to other i-adjectives as well : 「早くすぎる $\to$ 早すぎる」

This is not to say that Japanese people actually think of "〇〇 being too big" as the result of the object 〇〇 performing a "being too big" action/verb, and that English speaker view "being too big" as a quality/property of the object 〇〇. Rather, each respective way of communicating is simply what works best within their respective bubbles, and this does not neccessarilly affect a person's actual interpretation about the concept "being too big".
