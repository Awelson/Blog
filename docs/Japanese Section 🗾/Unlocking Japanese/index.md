is a [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unlocking-Japanese-Making-simple-really/dp/1539485501) written by [Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/@organicjapanesewithcuredol49), a Japanese Language YouTuber. Below you can find summaries + additional comments and notes for each chapter of the book.

> Obviously, language is a very weird thing. Any attempt at forming a theory to explain language is simply a model that aims to approximate its structure to as accurate of a degree as possible, but of course [All Models are Wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong). Although Cure Dolly makes several claims in this book, not all of them are true in the strictest sense. A model cannot possibly seek to cover all possible exceptions, so keep this in mind.
