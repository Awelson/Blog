# Chapter 3 - The Ga is always with Us

This chapter further hammers down the idea of が as a marker for grammatical subjects, and how its presence is always necessary in a Japanese sentence. Let's recap a bit : We know from the last chapter that a が-marked grammatical subject is present in the core structure of every japanese sentence in one of three forms :

- AがBです, where A is the grammatical subject and B is a (predicate) noun
- AがB, where A is the grammatical subject and B is a verb in plain form
- AがB, where A is the grammatical subject and B is an i-adjective

That is to say, a grammatical subject is either the "doer" of an action or the "manifester" of a quality / predicate noun. Of course, you will (quite frequently) encounter Japanese sentences without a が-marked subject but this is just the case of the subject being implicit. For example,

$$ 疲れた $$

is often translated as "I am tired", that is the presence of the subject "I" can be inferred from "疲れた" despite the absence of a "私" in the sentence. Indeed, if we try to forcibly make the presence of the subject explicit we get

$$ 私が \quad 疲れた $$

Given that you are able to infer the subject correctly based from the context, there is no difference in meaning between the sentence "疲れた" and "私が疲れた". In conversations, the contracted form is especially favored. After all, what is the point of including "私が" if it is easily inferable anyway. Another point I'd like to make is that the translation "I am tired" implies that "疲れた" is an adjective despite it being the past form of the verb "疲れる" whose English equivalent is the verb "to tire". Hence, a more accurate, albeit very awkward translation is "I tired".

## "I tired"

Despite how wrong this sounds, it is grammatically correct ("tire", although almost always used transitively, [can also be used intransitively](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tire)). It is in fact as grammatically correct as the sentence "I ran". We are simply taking the sentence "I tire" and turning the verb to its past tense.

$$ \begin{align*} \text{"I run"} \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad \text{"I ran"} \\
\text{"I tire"} \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad \text{"I tired"} \end{align*} $$

However, grammatical correctness does not equate to the "naturalness" of a sentence. It is, for no particular reason other than social convention, more natural to view "tired" as an adjective despite its alternative use as the past tense of the verb "tire". I make this point clear because it is important to understand that English translation of Japanese sentences aims for what is most natural sounding instead of being faithful to the Japanese text (this is of course a phenomenon that occurs with translation in general). As we shall see, these unfaithful translations are often the source of confusion in the learning process.

An additional point that I can make with this segway is to illustrate that there may exist multiple, grammatically correct ways to communicate the same idea, but that not necessarily all of them will be natural sounding(1). Point is : you may keep studying until every sentence you come up is grammatically correct, but at the end of the day it is a 50/50 on whether or not you will get a bunch of confused stares or a "日本語上手". The only way to learn to distinguish between what is and what is not natural sounding is through exposure to Japanese media or people.

1.  case in point, "I tired" vs "I am tired"

## クレープが食べたい

This sentence [has been used to prove](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-subject/) that there is no subject in Japanese grammar. This is a logical conclusion to make, the sentence translates to "I want to eat crepes" so "I" is the subject, but if that is the case then why is "クレープ" marked with a が? And if "クレープ" is indeed the subject, then wouldn't the sentence translate to "The crepe wants to eat"?

The source of confusion lies with our initial assumption that "クレープが食べたい" (accurately) translates to "I want to eat crepes". Of course as we have discussed, translations are not meant to be accurate. 食べたい is (the verb) 食べる attached to the auxiliary たい, which causes the verb to behave like an i-adjective[^1]. In this case, 食べたい is viewed as an adjective referring to "the state of wanting to be eaten". Thus, "(私は)クレープが食べたい"[^2] means "(To me), crepes manifest the state of wanting to be eaten" and in this more accurate translation "crepes" are indeed the subject of the sentence; thus the confusion is no more.

Another source of confusion is from people being unaware that "クレープが食べたい" cannot possibly be interpreted as "The crepe wants to eat" in the first place. This is because -たい is only used to express **your own** personal desire. To express some other entity's desire, [we use -たがる instead](https://jlptsensei.com/learn-japanese-grammar/たがる-tagaru-meaning/). By design, whenever you use -たい **you** are automatically the subject of the sentence.

> If we actually want to communicate "The crepe wants to eat" for some reason, then you could say "クレープが食べたがる".

[^1]: There is a bit of nuance with this statement. It is more accurate to say that attaching the たい auxiliary to a verb makes them conjugate like i-adjectives. After which, it appears that different people can in different scenarios either view the「verb + たい」combination as an adjective or as a verb. Both 〇〇が食べたい and 〇〇を食べたい are acceptable and regularly used to communicate the idea of wanting to eat 〇〇. However, viewing the「verb + たい」combination as an adjective, i.e. using が seems to be more favored. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/b2gdmi/what_is_the_difference_between_を_or_が_if_i_am/) for more perspectives on this matter.

[^2]: Just like how が-marked subjects are often omitted, は-marked topics are also often omitted.
