# Japanese Section 🗾

$\small こんにち$-what's up! This is the japanese section; where you will find all to do with Japan (except anime; because honestly that requires its own section).

This section will mostly consist of bits of Japanese culture I find interesting, and also some resources to do with learning Japanese. I am still learning myself so there might be inaccuracies when I present or translate relevant information. If you happen to notice any of these innaccuracies you can let me know by writing a comment (at the very bottom of the page).

This section is further split into various subsections which you may find below:

## - [Vocabulary](Vocabulary/index.md)

## - Culture

## - LLR

## - ... more soon
