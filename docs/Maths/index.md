# Maths

[ZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory) (Zermelo-Fraenkel + choice) is the most commonly used foundation of mathematics, and I don't like it. I much prefer to think about mathematics in the framework of [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory). If you don't know what type theory is, I suggest you give a quick skim of the wikipedia page before continuing.

Switching to this framework was no easy task, it is a difficult and relatively new field. Further, there are so many different versions of type theory, and with no clear dominant version you may be learning type theory from one resource and upon switching to a different resource find that a completely different approach is used. Still, it is worth it because type theory is a much more natural framework for mathematics than ZFC.

The version of type theory I am most comfortable with is the one that is implemented in [Lean Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/), an interactive theorem proving software with an existing [library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/index.html) of computerized definitions and proofs from a standard undergraduate curriculum. There is also plenty of [documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/) to aid with learning how to use the language. 

Still, my understanding of type theory doesn't exactly match that of Lean's. In fact, it is a very dumbed down version of it because I still can't understand some aspects of the language.

I will try to outline type theory based on my current rudimentary understanding at a [separate section](Type%20Theory/index.md). This includes explaining a syntax (which is quite similar to Lean's) which I use to deal with mathematics in a type-theoretic framework. I do this because all my future posts on mathematics will feature this syntax and framework.  

It is important to note that how I currently view type theory may not be accurate and some details may be overlooked, this is mostly on purpose because I don't understand enough to talk about it. 

> For example, I will treat an aspect I don't understand as some sort of [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). 

Without further ado, click [here](Type%20Theory/index.md) for an outline of type theory **as I see it**.
