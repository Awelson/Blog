うずまき is pronounced "uzumaki" and translates to whirlpool from Japanese. It is unclear why Machine Girl chose to give this song that name, I have tried scouring the internet to no avail. Some people have pointed out that うずまき could refer to the [horror manga series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzumaki) by the famous [Junji Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito).

> I will [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh_7mnoWyGQ) a video by FUNke talking about Junji Ito. It's very well produced!

The connection to Junji Ito is not far-fetched since the band's name comes from a 2008 Japanese movie, [The Machine Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Girl). But onto the music itself we go.. it is very chaotic with many moving parts, overwhelming but at the same time mesmerizing. I like that there are short calm segments of the music sprinkled in between the screaming, one of these segments in particular (1:39-1:49) is quite popular, more so than the actual song itself probably. 

This is because it was quite a popular trend at some point to make edits/animations based on this segment, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoXUfGdVPjs) for example. There are also people who have extended this segment to a [full song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rv0iFQLmz4). 

> This segment is actually a sample from the Sonic CD video game soundtrack: [Palmtree Panic "P" mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0L79dHcdH0).

I also want to share this [Chainsaw Man edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LrVqARAMvY) which uses うずまき, because it is just SO COOL.

### **04/09/2023**: [Willy Rodriguez](https://willyrodriguez.bandcamp.com/) ⋅ Bad Therapists

I'm back! Let's just ignore that August has only one song in it. I was busy moving places and while looking for some new music to listen to while packing I came across Willy Rodriguez. 

I was first drawn because the art style is similar to (in fact, inspired by) Car Seat Headrest's Twin Fantasy album cover AND I LOVE CAR SEAT HEADREST.

> You may also notice that this is also where I got my YouTube character from. 

The similarity is only in the artstyle, the music itself is quite different. It is more pop than rock, but both have lo-fi aspects. Anyways, I like their music and I listened to it on repeat while preparing to move. This EP in particular is my favorite so far.

I should also mention that Willy Rodriguez is a project by two people, William and [Star](https://starstarer.bandcamp.com/). They also go by WillyRodriguezWasTaken, because, well, Willy Rodiguez was already taken by [someone else](https://willyrodriguezmusic.com/).
