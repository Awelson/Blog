I'm back! Let's just ignore that August has only one song in it. I was busy moving places and while looking for some new music to listen to while packing I came across Willy Rodriguez. 

I was first drawn because the art style is similar to (in fact, inspired by) Car Seat Headrest's Twin Fantasy album cover AND I LOVE CAR SEAT HEADREST.

> You may also notice that this is also where I got my YouTube character from. 

The similarity is only in the artstyle, the music itself is quite different. It is more pop than rock, but both have lo-fi aspects. Anyways, I like their music and I listened to it on repeat while preparing to move. This EP in particular is my favorite so far.

I should also mention that Willy Rodriguez is a project by two people, William and [Star](https://starstarer.bandcamp.com/). They also go by WillyRodriguezWasTaken, because, well, Willy Rodiguez was already taken by [someone else](https://willyrodriguezmusic.com/).
