Sorry for the long break, but I'll make it up with today's good music. An absolutely beautiful piece of music with a just as beautiful piece of animation. There's not much information I can find on Vampillia, the band is really not that well known. They normally produce instrumental (apart from the screams lol) prog-rock, avant-garde type stuff, but they sometimes collab with singers to make vocal songs like in this case. 

Jun Togawa, the singer here, is an interesting character on her own and perhaps I will leave a discussion on her for a later time. The lyrics to this song are available but hard to find so I will leave a link [here](https://pastebin.com/iFzq22Lp) to it.
