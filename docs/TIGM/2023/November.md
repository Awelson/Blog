This piece is also often nicknamed "Wrong Note", the reason for it is apparent once you start listening to the song (and if you have a bit of a musical ear). Chopin intentionally plays the "wrong note", creating a [dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance), a phenomenon where the sounds of two notes sort of clash and don't sound nice together. Chopin however quickly switches back to playing the correct note, making things sound nice again. He repeats this pattern for the first part of the song, and for those of you that can read sheet music you can see this in action below:

This etude, and many other classical songs, were made popular by the anime "Your lie in April" ⋅ 四月は君の嘘. The video above in particular is a performance of "Wrong Note" from the anime's soundtrack: ”四月は君の嘘　僕と君との音楽帳”. I played the piano as a kid and that was what got me into watching this anime and exploring more about classical music. There are many more interesting pieces I've run into as a result, which I'll try to post here at some point.
