I refuse to believe that this song is humanly possible to sing. Especially that last part.. how is anyone supposed to do that. Yet.. yet, there are many covers of this song, I guess it just goes to show how talented these people are.

ALSO, the music video is just so beautifully detailed and colorful. I like the watercolor aesthetic as well.


### **2/12/2023**: [Akiko Yano](https://www.akikoyano.com/live/) ⋅ Water Ways Flow Backwards Again

A beautiful jazz piece by Akiko Yano, this rendition in particular is from her live album "[東京は夜の7時](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VN3XJ5UF10)" (Tokyo on a 7pm). Be sure to check out the other renditions (you can find them simply by searching the title on YouTube) because, as with jazz pieces, they vary greatly and are each their own experience.  

Surprisingly, this piece is used as a sample in the rap song "[回る ft. RITTO & 田我流](https://youtube.com/watch?v=c8x-g0qmn3A)" by KOJOE x Oliveoil. Personally, I don't think it gels well together but its cool to see the idea/attempt.
