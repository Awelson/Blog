A beautiful jazz piece by Akiko Yano, this rendition in particular is from her live album "[東京は夜の7時](東京は夜の7時)" (Tokyo on a 7pm). Be sure to check out the other renditions (you can find them simply by searching the title on YouTube) because, as with jazz pieces, they vary greatly and are each their own experience.  

Surprisingly, this piece is used as a sample in the rap song "[回る ft. RITTO & 田我流](https://youtube.com/watch?v=c8x-g0qmn3A)" by KOJOE x Oliveoil.
