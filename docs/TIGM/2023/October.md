I don't know what it is with people using Japanese in their music titles, but I'm all for it... I mean, it gives me more to talk about over here, but first! Pharoah Sanders was a brilliant saxophonist (the part at 4:13 gives me chills), he sadly passed away quite recently on September of 2022. 

The footage here comes from a 2007 DVD ["Pharoah Sanders - Live in San Fransisco"](https://www.discogs.com/release/5407319-Pharoah-Sanders-Live-In-San-Francisco), but it was recorded during July of 1982 at an abandoned tunnel somewhere in the [Marin Headlands](https://www.google.com/maps/search/marin+headlands/@37.8263368,-122.4998612,20.33z?entry=ttu). This is basically a live version of Kazuko (from the album "Journey to the One").

> The guy next to him is [Paul Arslanian](https://www.youtube.com/@paularslanian7570/featured) playing the harmonium. 

Now for the Japanese. The kanji for "Kazuko" is 和子 and it is used as a feminine Japanese name. It is composed of 和 (wa) meaning peace - as in the word 平和 (heiwa) - and 子 (ko) meaning child. Thus, Kazuko has the implied meaning "Peace Child", which is the alternative name this song is sometimes referred by.   

The [album version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOpmtFoZWjA) of Kazuko is quite different from this one. Notably it uses the japanese instrument, koto, for the background.
