> Preface : I am a huge fan of the anime [Given](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39533/Given)

Hi. It's been a while hasn't it? I went on a trip to Japan last September and made it into a sort of Given pilgrimage. I was lucky enough to be able to watch 海へ in the cinemas (it hadn't been released elsewhere outside of Japan at the time) and let me tell you, listening to 海へ for the first time in the cinema was AWESOME. I have never been to a concert before, so this is probably the closest I will ever get to a concert experience (for now at least).

This is also an interesting entry because the band syh is fictional and exists as a part of the story. However, it is now also able to exist in a real capacity through being labelled by Sony. Of course, there are real people involved in producing the music. Kizu Natsuki, the author of Given acts as the producer, with [centimillimental](https://www.cenmilli.com/) as the lyricist, and Fumiya Imai (Hiiragi's VA) as the vocalist.
