Esperanto is a [prog rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) band. The song I chose to highlight from them is a prog rock cover of a classical composition, [Danse Macabre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM), by [Camille Saint-Saëns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns). I just thought that it was an interesting idea, and I quite liked the cover as well.

> [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) also happens to be the name of the most widely spoken and successfull constructed language ([conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)). Whether this naming choice is intentional or has no real meaning is unapparent.
