Sion is Korean but was born and raised in Germany and only just recently moved back to Korea. Before officially making music, he [participated in The Voice Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3CY6N9lmdY), reaching the semi-finals.

He's gotten a lot better since then. Here is a [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3m1W8-k0d8) with a good collection of songs if you want more of his voice.

### **15/02/2024**: [Esperanto](https://www.esperanto-rock-orchestra.com/) ⋅ Danse Macabre

Esperanto is a [prog rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) band. The song I chose to highlight from them is a prog rock cover of a classical composition, [Danse Macabre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM), by [Camille Saint-Saëns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns). I just thought that it was an interesting idea, and I quite liked the cover as well.

> [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) also happens to be the name of the most widely spoken and successfull constructed language ([conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)). Whether this naming choice is intentional or has no real meaning is unapparent.
