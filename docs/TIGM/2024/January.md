This comes from her 8th studio album, Hejira, which apparently was mostly written in a car during a cross-country road trip from Maine to California. To reflect this, the title of the album comes from the Arabic word الهجرة (hijrah) which refers to the journey prophet Muhammad took from Mecca to Medina. Anyway, I think the origin story of this album is pretty cool, and the songs, especially coyote, also cool.
