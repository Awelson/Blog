This is the first time an artist has appeared twice on TIGM!! It's Pharaoh Sanders [again](/docs/TIGM/2023/October.md#15102023-pharoah-sanders--kazuko). This time I'm showcasing the 20 minute long "Harvest Time" from his 1977 self-titled album. The album was reissued in 2023, now including two live performances of "Harvest Time" and you can hear them [here](https://pharoahsanders.bandcamp.com/album/pharoah) (though they sound very different from the studio version).

### **08/05/2024**: [Sloche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloche_(band)) ⋅ Stadaconé

Sloche was a prog rock band formed in Quebec during the 1970s. Not much is known about them. They've only released two albums and this is the first song from the second. It's kinda sad to see bands just fade away into obscurity due to lack of popularity. Even if they do somehow become relevant many years later, it is ultimately too late. 


### **04/05/2024**: [Kendrick Lamar](https://oklama.com) ⋅ Euphoria

Now, I have no context about what the [beef is between Kendrick and Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake–Kendrick_Lamar_feud), but I'm just happy we are getting a bunch of sick diss tracks as a result. Euphoria by Kendrick is my favorite out of the several diss tracks thats been released so far. I like Kendrick's music in general, he's one of my favorites and is a very brilliant lyricist.
