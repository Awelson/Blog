I wrote down a lot more than I expected to for this song and I think the topics I went over are interesting enough to deserve its own page. You can find my exposition in the [Misc section](../../Misc/MAD.md).

This is a song featured in season 2 episode 4 of the anime [ClassicaLoid](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31157/ClassicaLoid) (Classical Vocaloid) and it is based on [Chopin's Minute Waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H0SRv8QNwk). The story goes that Chopin got the inspiration for this waltz as he was watching a small dog chase its tail. Indeed, the piece is also sometimes called Valse du petit chien, "The Little Dog Waltz".

Aside from music I've also always enjoyed animations that people come up to go along with the music. Moving on, I'd like to feature some of these animations into [TIGM](../index.md) as well. For an animation entry the first credit is to the animator and the second is to the music artist, followed by the title of the song. The video I will showcase is of the animation, but this does not always include the whole song, so if you enjoyed it do check out the full-length song as well.

Anyways this will be the first animation entry. I like the use of colors and the VHS vibe of it.
