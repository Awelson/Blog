Aside from music I've also always enjoyed animations that people come up to go along with the music. Moving on, I'd like to feature some of these animations into [TIGM](../index.md) as well. For an animation entry the first credit is to the animator and the second is to the music artist, followed by the title of the song. The video I will showcase is of the animation, but this does not always include the whole song, so if you enjoyed it do check out the full-length song as well.

Anyways this will be the first animation entry. I like the use of colors and the VHS vibe of it.
