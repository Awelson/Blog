This band is pretty unique in that all their songs feature their own constructed language ([conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)) known as "Alician". There are official translations to the song lyrics, thus making it possible to decode this language; [several people have undertaken this task](https://arcaea.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:ILuvGemz/Alice%E2%80%99s_Dictionary).
I initially thought that this seemed like a ridiculous (I mean that in a positive way) idea, but it turns out that songs sung in fictitious language are [not a rare occurrence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/41n3f7/looking_for_songs_sung_in_a_fictionalfake_or_dead/).
