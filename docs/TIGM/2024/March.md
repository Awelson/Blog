I randomly came across a chinese song which sounded familiar
from my childhood, then went on a rabbithole to find other similar songs. The end result is the playlist you see above. These are the songs I'd hear in the background when we went to restaurants with family or family friends, when we went to weddings, during chinese new year celebrations, and also from the CDs and cassettes my grandma would play when she was driving.
