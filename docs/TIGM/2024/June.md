It's pride month, so I will feature LGBT-themed songs for this month

### **27/06/2024**: When I See Him

This is a song from [HELLUVA BOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helluva_Boss) season 2 episode 8. HELLUVA BOSS is an animation series created by [Vivziepop](https://www.youtube.com/SpindleHorse), available on her channel (that means you can watch it for free, and you definitely should). 

There is also a [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXJRpH7t3_c) showcasing the performance by the voice actors, [Bryce Pinkham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Pinkham) (Stolas) and [Brandon Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Rogers_(YouTuber)) (Blitzo), which they absolutely killed. The lyrics are also filled with very fun (perhaps childish) word-play like in 2:08 which I suppose helps accentuate the contrast between how these two characters each feel about their relationship.

### **18/06/2024**: [Kevin Abstract](https://www.kevinabstract.co) â‹… Empty

This is the opener to Kevin Abstract's album, American Boyfriend. The music video also includes I Do (End Credits), the last song of the album, for.. well the end credits of the music video. This song was recommended to me by a friend. Although I do listen to BROCKHAMPTON (a rap band led by Kevin), I haven't had the chance to listen to Kevin's individual projects/music until recently and his stuff has been a pleasure to dive into so I'm glad for this recommendation.
