It's pride month, so I will feature LGBT-themed songs for this month

This is the opener to Kevin Abstract's album, American Boyfriend. The music video also includes I Do (End Credits), the last song of the album, for.. well the end credits of the music video. This song was recommended to me by a friend. Although I do listen to BROCKHAMPTON (a rap band led by Kevin), I haven't had the chance to listen to Kevin's individual projects/music until recently and his stuff has been a pleasure to dive into so I'm glad for this recommendation.
