It's pride month, so I will feature LGBT-themed songs for this month

### **30/06/2024**: [Car Seat Headrest](https://carseatheadrest.com) ⋅ Twin Fantasy

My favorite album of all time, really the first piece of music I came across that went the extra mile and made me feel things other than "damn.. this music is good". I've cried, anguished, laughed, you name it, all with this album playing in the background, fuelling those emotions. The story and emotions that Toledo was trying to convey through this concept album deeply resonated within me, and his music helped me process the things that were going on during that weird and confusing period in my life. 

To put it shortly, Twin Fantasy is a glimpse into the overarching story behind a relationship that was never meant to be; the highs, the lows, the little cracks, the nail in the coffin, and the aftermath. This album is a very intimate expression of Toledo's introspection of these events. 

There are actually two versions of this album, a [2011]() and 2018 version (you're listening to the 2018 version), the changes being a remaster of the audio and most importantly the minor changes in lyrics here and there which indicates a shift in perception regarding the break-up towards a general acceptance of the events.

### **28/06/2024**: Jason Tam & Anthony Rapp ⋅ Best Worst Mistake

Very cute song from a musical called [If/Then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If/Then). I first discovered this song, not from the musical, but from a Suntan (a ship from the game [OMORI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omori_(video_game))) [animatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbUhlypTlVs) which is just as cute.

### **27/06/2024**: When I See Him
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUOvuKW2O_I" width="560" height="315" title="A YouTube video" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a song from [HELLUVA BOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helluva_Boss) season 2 episode 8. HELLUVA BOSS is an animation series created by [Vivziepop](https://www.youtube.com/SpindleHorse), available on her channel (that means you can watch it for free, and you definitely should). 

There is also a [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXJRpH7t3_c) showcasing the performance by the voice actors, [Bryce Pinkham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Pinkham) (Stolas) and [Brandon Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Rogers_(YouTuber)) (Blitzo), which they absolutely killed. The lyrics are also filled with very fun (perhaps childish) word-play like in 2:08 which I suppose helps accentuate the contrast between how these two characters each feel about their relationship.

### **18/06/2024**: [Kevin Abstract](https://www.kevinabstract.co) ⋅ Empty

This is the opener to Kevin Abstract's album, American Boyfriend. The music video also includes I Do (End Credits), the last song of the album, for.. well the end credits of the music video. This song was recommended to me by a friend. Although I do listen to BROCKHAMPTON (a rap band led by Kevin), I haven't had the chance to listen to Kevin's individual projects/music until recently and his stuff has been a pleasure to dive into so I'm glad for this recommendation.
