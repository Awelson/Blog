Tell me you haven't seen a more hardcore album cover. This is the latest album from 八十八ヶ所巡礼, a Japanese rock band whose name is a reference to the [Shikoku Pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage), a pilgrimage route which involves visiting 88 Buddhist temples on the island of Shikoku. Accordingly, the band's lyrics contain references to [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), [Shintoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto), and [Yokai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai).
