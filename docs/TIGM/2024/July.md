This is a remixed version of "My Time" found in Pale Machine 2, which contains other remixed versions of songs from the original Pale Machine album. A [higher pitched version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgYj_qCHLg) of "My Time" was used in the game [OMORI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/) which is where I first heard this song. I still get chills from listening to it, but I unfortunately can't elaborate without getting into spoilers.

> Another cool "My Time" remix is the one by [Kikuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHl7JHiOxOM)

This song is filled with such hard hitting lines like "I can't go back to not knowing what you mean to me", "did you do something wrong was there something you did that I could blame", and "I was a situation that you were glad went away". It frickin hurts.

唐獅子牡丹 (Karajishi Botan) is a 1969 album by the jazz artist Akira Miyazawa. The album itself is a collection of jazz covers of theme songs of old Yakuza films (任侠映画), and traditional Japanese music (演歌). The album gets its name from the [Shôwa Zankyôden](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/昭和残侠伝シリーズ) series of Yakuza movies, specifically the second film "唐獅子牡丹". The track "唐獅子牡丹" appears as the first track of the B-side, and it is a jazzified version of the [theme song to the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJuxF65texc). 

唐獅子牡丹 (Karajishi Botan) is a combination of two traditional Japanese symbols, The Chinese Lion (唐獅子 - karajishi), and The Peony (牡丹 - botan). Patterns featuring these two symbols are often used in Yakuza tatoos, but also for clothes design, etc...

Tell me you haven't seen a more hardcore album cover. This is the latest album from 八十八ヶ所巡礼, a Japanese rock band whose name is a reference to the [Shikoku Pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage), a pilgrimage route which involves visiting 88 Buddhist temples on the island of Shikoku. Accordingly, the band's lyrics contain references to [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), [Shintoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto), and [Yokai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai).
