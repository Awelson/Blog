唐獅子牡丹 (Karajishi Botan) is a 1969 album by the jazz artist Akira Miyazawa. The album itself is a collection of jazz covers of theme songs of old Yakuza films (任侠映画), and traditional Japanese music (演歌). The album gets its name from the [Shôwa Zankyôden](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/昭和残侠伝シリーズ) series of Yakuza movies, specifically the second film "唐獅子牡丹". The track "唐獅子牡丹" appears as the first track of the B-side, and it is a jazzified version of the [theme song to the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJuxF65texc). 

唐獅子牡丹 (Karajishi Botan) is a combination of two traditional Japanese symbols, The Chinese Lion (唐獅子 - karajishi), and The Peony (牡丹 - botan). Patterns featuring these two symbols are often used in Yakuza tatoos, but also for clothes design, etc...

Tell me you haven't seen a more hardcore album cover. This is the latest album from 八十八ヶ所巡礼, a Japanese rock band whose name is a reference to the [Shikoku Pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage), a pilgrimage route which involves visiting 88 Buddhist temples on the island of Shikoku. Accordingly, the band's lyrics contain references to [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), [Shintoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto), and [Yokai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai).
