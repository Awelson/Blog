# Today in Good Music
Inspired by [Mikasacus's](https://www.youtube.com/@mikasacus) tradition of sharing a piece of music he likes at the description of every uploaded video ---

I will try (my best) to share and talk a bit about a piece of music that I find cool each day. This can be a single song or an entire albumn, I also listen to and enjoy most genres so you will find the catalouge to be quite diverse.
