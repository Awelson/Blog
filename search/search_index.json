This is a reference to the fact that the idiom \"\u6cb9\u3092\u58f2\u308b\" originates from hair oil sellers during the Edo period who were often known to engage in idle chatter or gossip with women while doing business, and thus were often seen as slacking off instead of doing work.</p> <p>Later, the student says \"\u6642\u9593\u6f70\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\" which would normally be interpreted as \"He's just killing some time / loafing around now\", but of course the fabric of space-time is literally being compressed, speeding up the flow of time as he speaks. Again, he has to relay to the coach to take his words literally and that space-time is actually falling

For example, imagine the following situation :</p> <ul> <li>Scene 1 : Something happens to character A</li> <li>Scene 2 : Character B shows up and asks what happened</li> <li>Scene 3 : Character A explains the situation</li> </ul> <p>Now, the author may make \"Character A\" go through the whole song and dance of explaining the situation, or they may simply make \"Character A\" say something like \"\u307e\u3041\u3002\u3002\u304b\u304f\u304b\u304f\u3057\u304b\u3058\u304b\u3067\u3053\u3046\u306a\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f\".

It is also the name of a deer mascot character used by Daihatsu for advertisments and such. This is probably a pun, \\(\\stackrel{\\tiny \u3057\u304b}{\\footnotesize \u9e7f}\\) being the kanji for deer.</p> <p>In the anime, it was also mentioned that \u304b\u304f\u304b\u304f\u3057\u304b\u3058\u304b was used in the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6 (Man'y\u014dsh\u016b), an 8th century anthology of Japanese poetry. Both \u304b\u304f\u304b\u304f and \u3057\u304b\u3058\u304b are archaic ways of saying \u3053\u3046\u3060/\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b<sup>4</sup> and so it seems that people of the time decided to combine them to create the \u304b\u304f\u304b\u304f\u3057\u304b\u3058\u304b that we know of today.

Ohshima's blunder stems from mistakenly marking \u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7 (pillbug in Japanese) with the particle \u306b\u3082. </p> <p>In most cases, including this one, \u306b\u3082 can be thought of as the particles \u306b and \u3082 operating separately<sup>3</sup>. That is to say, \u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7 is marked twice, once by \u306b and the second time by \u3082. Marking an object with the particle \u3082 gives it a sense of \"also\", \"another\", \"yet again\", etc... For example :</p> <p><pre><code>\u300c\u79c1\u3082\u308a\u3093\u3054\u304c\u597d\u304d\u300d: I too like apples \n\u300c\u308a\u3093\u3054\u3082\u3059\u304d\u300d: I like apples too\n</code></pre> In the first case you are proclaiming yourself as an (additional) member of the \"apple-liker\" group. You would say this when your friends are talking about how much they love apples, and you want to include yourself as a part of that. In the second case you are proclaiming that apples are also a member of the \"things-I-like\" group. For example, if someone asks \"Are bananas the only fruit you like?\" then \u308a\u3093\u3054\u3082\u597d\u304d would be an appropriate response.</p> <p>The particle \u306b is more complex as it has many functions. In this specific instance \u306b acts as :</p> <p>\"a particle that indicates an agent or a source in passive, causative, \u3082\u3089\u3046/\u3066\u307e\u3089\u3046 and other receiving constructions\"</p> <ul> <li>This is the third (out of seven) functions of \u306b according to the dictionary of Japanese grammar (DOJG)<sup>4</sup>. </li> </ul> <p>Isolating the key parts of Ohshima's sentence, we get</p> <pre><code>\u5927\u5cf6 : [\u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7] [\u306b\u3082] [\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066] [\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f]\n</code></pre> <p>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f is the past tense of the verb \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f, which means \"to recieve\". You've probably heard the phrase \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059 (itadakimasu) being used before eating a meal. In this context, \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059 basically means : \"I shall humbly receive/accept the food that is in front of me\". </p> <ul> <li>\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f is no different to \u3082\u3089\u3046 apart from being more polite (it is the \u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e of \u3082\u3089\u3046)</li> </ul> <p>A verb can be attached to \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f via its \u3066-form to indicate the receival of an action. In this case :</p> <pre><code>\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b (to explain) -&gt; \u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066 + \u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f : (I) received an explanation\n</code></pre> <p>As discussed, \u306b marks the agent/source of the action (\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b) that is being received. Thus :</p> <pre><code>\u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7\u306b(\u3082)\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f : (I) received an explanation from a pillbug \n</code></pre> <p>That \u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7 is also marked with a \u3082 indicates that the pillbug is part of a larger collection of things that you have received explanations from, or alternatively that the explanation from a pillbug is part of a larger series of events that happened. The second interpretation is probably more accurate.</p> <p>And so that concludes the explanation behind the grammatical mishap that took the attention of more than 18 million people, the pillbug incident. </p>"},{"location":"Japanese%20Section/Misc/pillbug/#part-3-wait-theres-more","title":"Part 3 : Wait?

After searching around for a bit, I have found at least one case (probably the only case) in which this construction is possible : In attributive clauses, \u306e marks the agent performing an action that serves as an attribute of something else<sup>5</sup>. </p> <p>For example :</p> <pre><code>\u96ea\u306e\u964d\u308b\u591c : A snowy night\n\u30ab\u30ca\u30a8\u306e\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30b9 : The necklace that Kanae made\n</code></pre> <p>In general, we would have : <code>Noun1 + \u306e + Verb + Noun2</code>, where <code>Noun1</code> is the performer of <code>Verb</code> and this serves as an attribute for <code>Noun2</code>. However <code>\u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f</code> does not have a <code>Noun2</code>. Does this mean that the \u306e-corrected sentence is ungrammatical? Surely Yamaguchi's correction to Ohshima's grammar mistake can't yet again be another grammar mistake, that would be too embarassing.</p> <p>What we have overlooked is to understand that \u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b is a noun that has been \"verbified\" by the addition of \u3059\u308b. That is to say \u89e3\u8aac is the noun \"explanation\" while \u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b is the verb \"to explain\". The idea is to treat\u300c\u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u300das the noun \"explanation about pillbugs\" and observe that the addition of \u3059\u308b turns it into the verb \"to explain about pillbugs\". </p> <p>Putting it all togther, \u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f means \"I recieved an explanation about pillpugs\" which was probably what Ohshima meant to say.</p>"},{"location":"Japanese%20Section/Misc/pillbug/#part-4-another-correction","title":"Part 4 : Another Correction","text":"<pre><code>\u5927\u5cf6 : \u9055\u3046\u9055\u3046\u3002\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093\u3001\u9055\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093\u3001\u30c0\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u30b7\"\u3082\"\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3051\u3069\u3063\u3066\u3002\n\u8a00\u304a\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u3082\u3002\u79c1\u304c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u8272\u3005\u9593\u9055\u3048\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3002\n</code></pre> <p>\"No, no, Yamaguchi-san.

The song is mainly in Cantonese, with some Chinese and Japanese, and a sentence of English, making it consist of 4 languages in total (very cool).

A classical example of this is the song\u300c\u67f4\u53c8\u300d, also by 2\u53f7.</p> <p> </p> <p>Check this playlist out for a full list of examples</p> <p>The \u97f3MAD genre is a derivative of the MAD\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc (MADmovie) genre of videos which is, well, a term used to describe videos created by editing, combining, and reconstructing existing audio, images, videos, and animations from media like TV and games : Old Example 1, Old Example 2, Old Example 3, Modern Example. </p> <p>Sometimes, original animations, music, etc... are created in order to facilitate the \"mashing\" of different media sources. For example, this original animation by\u300c\u7d75\u3092\u63cf\u304d\u30de\u30c4\u30bb\u300d was created to insert characters from Dungeon Meshi into the Chainsaw Man 4th episode ED. This type of MAD in particular is known as a \u624b\u63cf\u304dMAD.</p> <p>This is not a Japan-specific cultural phenomenon (although it does appear to be a lot more popular in the Japan-sphere). The western equivalent of this cultural phenomenon is known as YouTube Poop or YTP for short.

Rather, I believe it is meant to be an exploration/experiment in the application of editing techniques and effects normally used in the \u97f3MAD genre (like repetition, random cuts, reverb, pitch changes, etc...) to an otherwise normal electronic/techno song. Indeed, the song title itself roughly translates to \"to mince/chop up a song\" and the video presents itself like an \u97f3MAD tutorial, explaining the use of different effects with text. It is essentially a song disguised as an \u97f3MAD tutorial (or an \u97f3MAD tutorial disguised as a song). The arrangement of\u300c\u539f\u66f2\u3092\u523b\u3080\u300dby \u5893\u77f3 cleans up and effectively \"de-minces\" the original song, making the significance/message behind the naming harder to discern.    </p>"},{"location":"Misc/MAD/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ol> <li>https://dic.pixiv.net/a/2\u53f7.</li> <li>https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/2\u53f7\u5144\u8cb4</li> <li>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u97f3MAD</li> <li>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc</li> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_poop</li> <li>https://note.com/99991001/n/nd8553bc8095b</li> </ol>"},{"location":"STEM/","title":"STEM","text":"<p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Basically, all of these disagreements are due to the question being ill defined; what exactly do we mean by \"cold\" and is \u00b0C even an appropriate unit/scale to quantify \"cold\" with in the first place?</p> <p>My personal approach, which I introduced in the video, was to create an artificial scale that measures \"coldness\". The idea is that most people tend to interpret anything below room temperature (which I will assume to be 25\u00b0C) as cold. In other words, the further away we are (in the negative direction) from room temperature the colder it is. Therefore, we shall assign a \"coldness\" score depending on how far a temperature is from 25\u00b0C, for example a temperature of 20\u00b0C has a \"coldness\" score of 5 and so on.</p> <p>With this approach, the answer to the question \"What is twice colder than 0\u00b0C?\" is given as follows : 0\u00b0C has a \"coldness\" score of 25, something twice colder would mean a \"coldness\" score of 50, and converting that back into \u00b0C gives -25\u00b0C as the final answer.</p> <p>Of course, the \"correctness\" of my answer depends on whether or not you agree with this artificial \"coldness\" scale that I just conjured up. For example, you may not agree that room temperature is 25\u00b0C, or you could argue that wind and humidity should be taken into account as well when creating the scale.

There is a distinction between \"length\" and the space of possible observations that our measurement tool can detect and report.

There is nothing taboo about doing this, but it helps to be aware of these sorts of decisions.</p>"},{"location":"STEM/twicecolder/#level-of-measurement","title":"Level of measurement","text":"<p>This refers to the different types of scales we measure our variables with. The most well known classification of these scales is that proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens which consists of \"Nominal\", \"Ordinal\", \"Interval\", and \"Ratio\" scales. </p> <p>In mathematical terms, measurement of a variable \\(V\\) refers to the process of assigning an individual \\(i\\in I\\) to a value in the range \\(R\\) of \\(V\\).</p> <p>The \"scale\" used by \\(V\\) for a measurement refers to the range of possible values that \\(i\\in I\\) can be assigned to, in other words, the \"scale\" used by \\(V\\) is synonymous to \\(R\\). However, a scale may have additional properties beyond the values that inhabit it, as we shall discuss.</p> <p>Nominal Scale</p> <p>A nominal scale consists only of a number of distinct classes or categories, for example: \\(\\{\\text{Cat, Dog, Rabbit}\\}\\) . No kind of relationship between the classes can be relied upon. Measuring with a nominal scale is thus equivalent to classification; you are classifying a particular individual \\(i\\in I\\) as either a cat, dog, or a rabbit.</p> <p>Ordinal Scale</p> <p>An ordinal scale is similar to a nominal scale, but the categories have a natural ordering. For example, with letter grades in an exam there is a natural ordering : F \\(&lt;\\) E \\(&lt;\\) D \\(&lt;\\) C \\(&lt;\\) B \\(&lt;\\) A.</p> <p>Mathematically speaking, the categories in an ordinal scale have a total preorder structure. This means that there is a binary relation \\(\\leq\\) on \\(R\\) (the set of categories in the ordinal scale) satisfying :</p> <ul> <li>Transitivity : For all \\(x,y,z\\in R\\), \\(x\\leq y\\) and \\(y\\leq z\\) implies \\(x\\leq z\\)</li> <li>Strong connectedness : For all \\(x,y\\in R\\), either \\(x\\leq y\\) or \\(y\\leq x\\)</li> </ul> <p>Of course, such a binary relation can be constructed for any set of categories, but it is important that the resulting ordering is meaningful. Measuring with an ordinal scale is equivalent to comparing different individuals, or assigning a \"level\" to each of them.</p> <p>There is no notion of distance on an ordinal scale. For example, if we have a set of horses with \"rank in a race\" as a variable, then we cannot say anything certain about the \"distance\" between first place and second place. The first place horse could have won by a few seconds or a few minutes. We know that this horse performed better than the second place horse, but the degree to which it performed better is unknown when we use the ordinal scale.</p> <p>Interval Scale</p> <p>An interval scale is similar to an ordinal scale, but with an added notion of distance. What this means is that we can \"subtract\" categories on the scale and obtain a numerical value which represents the degree to which these categories differ.</p> <p>For example, the \"difference\" between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C is represented by the numerical value 10 while for 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C it is 30. </p> <ul> <li> <p>We can compare these differences : there is a greater degree of difference between 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C compared to between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C (since 30 \\(&gt;\\) 10)</p> </li> <li> <p>We can also talk about the ratios of differences : the difference between 20\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C is three times that of the difference between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C (since 3 \\(\\times\\) 10 = 30)</p> </li> </ul> <p>However, while we can take \"differences\" between categories, we cannot \"divide\" categories to obtain a ratio. That is to say, it doesn't make sense to say that 40\u00b0C is \"twice hotter\" than 20\u00b0C. The reason for this is that the \"zero\" on the scale has to properly represent a complete absence of whatever variable we are measuring in order for the notion of ratios to make sense. </p> <p>With \u00b0C, the \"zero\" was arbitrarily chosen as the freezing point of water. When used as a scale to measure thermal energy, \u00b0C does not have a proper \"zero\" in the sense that things can and do get colder than 0\u00b0C; hence 0\u00b0C does not represent an absolute lack of thermal energy. In contrast, the Kelvin scale has a \"proper zero,\" corresponding to absolute zero\u2014the theoretical point at which all molecular motion ceases. Similarly, when used as a scale to measure \"coldness\", 0\u00b0C does not represent an absolute lack of \"coldness\".</p> <p>The point is, if \"zero\" represents \"something (i.e. not nothing)\" on the scale, then multiplication and division are not permissible operations that can be performed on the scale. Multiplying \"something\" (by a value greater than one) increases the amount of that \"something\", but if that \"something\" is represented by 0 on the scale, then multiplying on the scale will, on the contrary, have no effect.</p> <p>Ratio Scale</p> <p>A ratio scale is an interval scale with a \"zero\" that properly represents an absolute lack of whatever variable that is being measured. Having satisfied this property, multiplication and division are permissible operations when working on this scale. This means that we can properly talk about ratios between the categories of the scale. </p> <p>Examples include weight (measured in grams), length (measured in meters), time (measured in seconds), etc... 0g means an absence of any weight, 0cm means an absence of any length, etc... It perfectly makes sense to say that twice the weight of 50kg is 100kg or half the length of 10cm is 5cm and so on.</p> <p>There are some valid criticisms to the \"Nominal\", \"Ordinal\", \"Interval\", \"Ratio\" classification of measurement scales proposed by Stevens and it remains a hot topic of debate to this day. <sup>1</sup></p>"},{"location":"STEM/twicecolder/#back-to-question-2","title":"Back to Question 2","text":"<p>As a reminder :</p> <p>Question 2.

For example inputting <code>\u624b\u63cf\u304dOMORI</code> as a search string in YouTube will provide you with a whole list.</p> <p>\"\\(\\small \\stackrel{\\tiny \u3066}{\u624b}\\stackrel{\\tiny \u304c}{\u63cf}\u304d\\)\" (or alternatively \\(\\small \\stackrel{\\tiny \u3066}{\u624b}\\stackrel{\\tiny \u304c}{\u66f8}\u304d\\)) translates to handwriting (according to Jisho) and is to be used as a noun. However I find it is more frequently used to refer to something that is hand-drawn, hand-painted, or specifically in this case a hand-drawn (not in a literal sense but with a drawing tablet) animation.</p> <p>\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 this means you can type <code>\u624b\u63cf\u304d[INSERT_FANDOM]</code> into a search engine and find some cool animations relating to a particular fandom from Japanese creators.  </p>"},{"location":"TIGM/2023/November/","title":"November","text":""},{"location":"TIGM/2023/November/#23112023-maurice-ravel-le-tombeau-de-couperin","title":"23/11/2023: Maurice Ravel \u22c5 Le Tombeau de Couperin","text":"<p>Maurice Ravel was a French composer.

Here, Couperin is thought to be Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, a French Baroque composer from the 17th century (the Couperin family is itself a musical family, much of the members are famous composers as well). However, Ravel did not write this piece in memory of Couperin, but instead in memory of his friends that died in WW1 while he served in the army.

Chopin however quickly switches back to playing the correct note, making things sound nice again. He repeats this pattern for the first part of the song, and for those of you that can read sheet music you can see this in action below:</p> <p></p> <p>This etude, and many other classical songs, were made popular by the anime \"Your lie in April\" \u22c5 \u56db\u6708\u306f\u541b\u306e\u5618.

Not much is known about them. They've only released two albums and this is the first song from the second. It's kinda sad to see bands just fade away into obscurity due to lack of popularity. Even if they do somehow become relevant many years later, it is ultimately too late. </p>"},{"location":"TIGM/2024/May/#04052024-kendrick-lamar-euphoria","title":"04/05/2024: Kendrick Lamar \u22c5 Euphoria","text":"<p>Now, I have no context about what the beef is between Kendrick and Drake, but I'm just happy we are getting a bunch of sick diss tracks as a result. Euphoria by Kendrick is my favorite out of the several diss tracks thats been released so far.

It's been a while hasn't it? I went on a trip to Japan last September and made it into a sort of Given pilgrimage. I was lucky enough to be able to watch \u6d77\u3078 in the cinemas (it hadn't been released elsewhere outside of Japan at the time) and let me tell you, listening to \u6d77\u3078 for the first time in the cinema was AWESOME. I have never been to a concert before, so this is probably the closest I will ever get to a concert experience (for now at least).</p> <p>This is also an interesting entry because the band syh is fictional and exists as a part of the story. However, it is now also able to exist in a real capacity through being labelled by Sony. Of course, there are real people involved in producing the music. Kizu Natsuki, the author of Given acts as the producer, with centimillimental as the lyricist, and Fumiya Imai (Hiiragi's VA) as the vocalist.</p>"}]}
