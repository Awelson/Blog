# Vocabulary

This space is used to document any vocabulary I have learned through watching and listening to Japanese media. I find that this is an easy way to learn vocabulary since a particular media (typically anime) may often repeatedly use the same words / phrases. 

>A classic example is the phrase "$\small \overset{\tiny わたし}{私}\overset{\tiny き}{気}になります$" which is often said by Chitanda from the anime [Hyouka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka) when she want's to express her curiosity.

Below you may find a list of media from which I have learned some vocabulary through this method:
